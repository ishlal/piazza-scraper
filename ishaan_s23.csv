"QUESTION: <p>My TA today said I should look at the recitation solution to see how I should write the homework solution but I can&#39;t see it yet. Is it not up? Also, some of the questions seem very obvious and I feel like the way I&#39;m proving is incorrect.

"QUESTION: <p>How do we prove that a number is an integer?</p>
","ANSWER: <p>If you&#39;re just looking at a number, say 7, you can just say that it is an integer. But if it is a more abstract quantity (such as the product/sum of other numbers/variables), then some sort of justification based on the closure of integers would suffice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, suppose I want to show that $$k = 2x + y$$ is an integer. And suppose we know that $$x$$ and $$y$$ are integers, then you could just say that $$k$$ is an integer because $$x$$ and $$y$$ are integers and the integer set is closed under addition and multiplication.</p>

"QUESTION: <p>Hi!</p>
<p><br />I just got a bit confuse on the way that the proof on 2.sp2 was done for ((A \ B) ∪ (A ∩ B) ⊆ A ). I understood all the mathematical computations on why x (an arbitrary element) belongs to A, but got stuck on the reasoning why by given that x ∈ A and x ∈ (A \ B) ∪ (A ∩ B),  (A \ B) ∪ (A ∩ B) ⊆ A  must be true. Why couldn&#39;t it be the other way around where A ⊆ (A \ B) ∪ (A ∩ B) ? <br /><br />Thanks in advance! </p>
","ANSWER: <p>Well that conclusion is being made because we are under the case of showing that $$(A \setminus B) \cup (A \cap B) \subseteq A$$. Remember, to show equality, we show inclusion in both directions. So focusing on the direction $$(A \setminus B) \cup (A \cap B) \subseteq A$$, we would want to show that for any element that appears in the left hand side, it must also appear in the right hand side. 2.sp2 argues that for any element $$x \in (A \setminus B) \cup (A \cap B)$$, we have $$x \in A$$, so we have that any element in the left hand side also appears in the right hand side (since x was arbitrary), and by definition of subset, we conclude that the left hand side is a subset of the right hand side. </p>
<p></p>
<p>We then go on to show the inclusion in the other direction. And to show that, we would go about taking an arbitrary element of $$A$$ and show that it appears in $$(A \setminus B) \cup (A \cap B)$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I think the key thing to note is the definition of subset. We have $$A \subset B$$ if and only if for every element $$a \in A$$, we also have $$a \in B$$. That&#39;s what we are doing in the set proofs; we consider an element $$a \in A$$ and then show that it must be that $$a \in B$$ and then conclude that $$A \subseteq B$$</p>

<p>Which sets are they referring to when they say the sets are pairwise disjoint? I thought if the sets were pairwise disjoint they could not have any elements in common.</p>
","ANSWER: <p>Each $$S_i$$ is <strong>a set of sets, </strong>and it is true that the $$S_i$$&#39;s are pairwise disjoint with respect to one another.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is because, consider any two of these sets $$S_i$$ and $$S_j$$, for an arbitrary $$x \in S_i$$, we have $$|x| = i$$. However, we know that for any $$y \in S_j$$ we have $$|y| = j$$.

"QUESTION: 
","ANSWER: <p>In one sentence: Stars and bars is an <strong>application</strong> of simple combinations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For more detail, with simple combinations, such as $$\binom{n}{r}$$, we are simply considering a set of $$n$$ distinct items and determining how many ways can we choose $$r$$ of these items. Equivalently, this counts the number of subsets of size $$r$$ from our original set.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Stars and bars can be thought of as a two step procedure. We see a direct correlation between distributing indistinguishable items to distinguishable containers with an arrangement of stars and bars. So to count the number of ways to distribute, we count the number of arrangements of stars and bars. Suppose we have $$n$$ stars and $$r-1$$ bars, then our procedure would begin by choosing $$n$$ locations to put the stars. Since the remaining open slots <strong>must</strong> be filled with bars, they can only be filled in one way. So by MR, you get the familiar equation for stars and bars which is $$\binom{n + r - 1}{n}$$, or equivalently, $$\binom{n+r-1}{r-1}$$</p>

","ANSWER: <p>g and h are examples of functions that have the domain $$B^A$$ and codomain $$2^C$$. So the domain of g and h are <strong><em>functions</em></strong> and the codomain of g and h are <strong>subsets of [1..n].</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>A good question is what is the size of the domain? And what is the size of the codomain? </p>
<p></p>
<p>The domain has size $$n^n$$ and the codomain has size $$2^n$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>To understand the function $$g$$, consider an arbitrary function $$\phi: [1..n] \rightarrow [1..n]$$. Note that $$\phi \in [1..n]^{[1..n]}$$, so it is in the domain. Note that $$\phi$$ takes as input $$x \in [1..n]$$ and outputs some $$y \in [1..n]$$. That is, $$\phi(x) = y$$ where $$x, y \in [1..n]$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When evaluating $$g(\phi)$$, we note that the mapping is defined by $$\{x | f(x) = 1\}$$ where $$x \in [1..n]$$. Therefore, the mapping is looking at all elements of $$[1..n]$$ such that when $$\phi$$ acts on that element, the output is $$1$$. These elements form a subset of $$[1..n]$$. How exciting! Let&#39;s call this subset $$A$$. That is, we have $$A \subseteq [1..n]$$ and $$\forall a \in A$$, we have $$\phi(a) = 1$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, $$g(\phi) = A$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For function $$h$$, we do something similar, but now $$h$$ maps $$\phi$$ to its range (which is also a subset of $$[1..n]$$). </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>For the last part of the question, we are given $$f$$ as the identity function. This means, $$\forall x \in [1..n]$$ we have $$f(x) = x$$. We want to compute $$g(f)$$. This is equivalent to asking: &#34;What is the set $$A \subseteq [1..n]$$ such that $$\forall a \in A$$ we have $$f(a) = 1$$?&#34;. Well, if $$f$$ is the identity, then it must be that $$A = \{1\}$$. Therefore, $$g(f) = \{1\}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For $$h(f)$$ we ask ourselves, &#34;if $$f$$ is the identity function, what is $$Ran(f)$$?&#34;. Well, this is just $$[1..n]$$. So, we have $$h(f) = [1..n]$$</p>

<p>What is the set J? Is this the set that we&#39;re finding the intersections for when we&#39;re counting using PIE? Also, can you explain the RHS - why are we placing elements in the other n-k positions?</p>
","ANSWER: <p>J is just an arbitrary subset of $$[1..n]$$. It basically narrows down which values we are focusing on (of whether or not they are in the right position) in the permutation. </p>
<p></p>
<p>For the RHS, recall that elements of $$\bigcap_{j \in J} B_j$$ will be those permutations such that the elements of $$j$$ are in the right position. So we can compute the cardinality of this via a procedure where in the first step, we fix the elements of $$J$$ in their correct position (of which there are $$k$$ elements) and then we permute the remaining elements. The first step occurs in just 1 way, and the second step occurs in $$(n-k)!$$ ways.</p>

"QUESTION: <p>I was doing some practice questions I found online and one was about proving that some set operations equaled the empty set.</p>

<p>In this class, we learned double inclusion to prove equality between two sets, but I figure you can&#39;t do that for empty sets because there is no abp element of an empty set.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So how would we approach proving this rigorously? Just show that the operations limit the scope of the set to nothing?</p>
","ANSWER: <p>I suppose you could do the normal double inclusion method. Suppose you were asked to prove $$LHS = \emptyset$$. You could go about showing $$LHS \subseteq \emptyset$$ by considering an arbitrary element of the LHS and reach some sort of verdict based on that. And then when you show $$\emptyset \subseteq LHS$$, you would not have to consider an arbitrary element, because $$\emptyset \subseteq A$$ for any set $$A$$.

"QUESTION: <p>For Q4, I have a solution that works as follows (very brief explanation):</p>
<p></p>
<p>Choose arbitrary TA t1 out of the n possible TAs. Denote set W to be all the TA&#39;s t1 directly wins over and set L to be all the TA&#39;s t1 directly loses to. Then 2 cases:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Case 1: every element in L lost to at least 1 element in W so therefore TA t1 is supreme since either directly or indirectly beat everyone.  Done!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Case 2: there exists some TA t2 in the set L that beats every TA in the set W. From here we can restart the process considering TA t2 to be the new potential supreme TA, the set W to be the same set as before &#43; t1 &#43; any number of elements in the set L that t2 directly beats (key point is that |W| can increase from before as it only gains new elements and can not lose element). The set L will be the same as before but will lose t2 and any elements that were initially in L that t2 directly beats (key point is that |L| decreases because L can only lose elements not gain any. </p>
<p></p>
<p>From there repeat the two cases with TA t2 as the new potential supreme TA with the new set W and the new set L. Since W can only grow, and L can only lose elements then we can continue the process until Case 1 reached or |L| becomes 0 and therefore case 1 reached. </p>
<p></p>
<p>So sorry for the long explanation but hope that made sense. My question is can I use this form of proof here? Am I allowed to simply say continue the process until case 1 is reached (therefore defining a supreme TA) or |L| = 0 which also defines a supreme TA?  </p>

","ANSWER: Yes
"
"QUESTION: <p>this is for personal understanding only and in no means related to required material, but can expectation be thought of as a linear operator? More exactly, $$\hat{E}:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, $$ $$\hat{E}(X) = \vec{x} \cdot \vec{p}$$, where $$p_i = Pr[X=x_i]$$ and $$x_i \in Val(X)$$</p>
","ANSWER: <p>sort of. We can see that the canonical equation for expectation of $$\mathbb E[X] = \sum_{x \in Val(x)} x \cdot \Pr[X = x]$$ is indeed a linear function. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I wouldn&#39;t say that the domain of your provided $$\hat{E}$$ is $$\mathbb R$$ because we define a random variable to be a <strong>function</strong>. </p>

"
"QUESTION: Why are we solving for when we are returning the ith pair of sock? How does this lead us to find the expected pair of socks
","ANSWER: <p>The total amount of socks being returned can be thought of as a sum of a bunch of $$1$$&#39;s and $$0$$&#39;s, where a 1 indicates if the sock has been returned and a 0 otherwise. For example, suppose we put in 3 pairs of socks (we&#39;ll label these pairs A, B, and C) and only received 2 back. And further, suppose that we didn&#39;t receive pair B back. Then, it is true that we received 1 &#43; 0 &#43; 1 = 2 pairs back (1 for A and 1 for C). This is essentially what indicators are. So if we were to define an indicator for each pair of socks, and sum them all together, we would get the total amount of pairs returned.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thus, if $$S = I_1 + I_2 + ... + I_n$$, then $$\mathbb{E}[S] = \mathbb{E}[I_1 + I_2 + ... + I_n]$$. And by using Linearity of Expectation, we have this being equal to $$\mathbb{E}[I_1] + \mathbb{E}[I_2] + ... + \mathbb{E}[I_n] = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{E}[I_i]$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So our problem has been reduced to finding the expected value of an indicator, where the indicator is whether or not the $$i$$th pair is returned. By finding this value, we can easily obtain $$\mathbb{E}[S]$$ using the math above.</p>

Remember, a random variable, say $$X$$, is defined to be a <strong>function: </strong>$$X: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb R$$. This means that for each element of your outcome space, the random variable assigns it some real number value via some function you have defined. It is possible for there to be an $$\omega \in \Omega$$ such that $$\Pr[\omega] = 0$$, but since $$\omega \in \Omega$$, $$X(\omega)$$ must have some real value assigned to it (since $$\Omega$$ is the domain of $$X$$). </p>

","ANSWER: <p>the short answer is &#34;probably&#34;. The long answer would require a lot more conversation about what you are intending to do by &#34;focusing&#34; on the first 10 dice rolls. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In general, I would try to avoid a &#34;sub-probability space&#34; and rather just define an event. Most ideas I can think of that involve &#34;focusing on the first 10 dice&#34; can be solved by just defining an event and giving its corresponding probability.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, I could define $$E$$ to be the event that the first 10 dice rolls are all even numbers. And this would be a perfectly fine event definition since $$E \subseteq \Omega$$. And then we could go about computing $$Pr[E]$$ in whichever way fancies us.<br /><br />ADDENDUM: In general when we &#34;restrict&#34; the sample space like this we need to show that the new probability problem is equivalent to the old problem. </p>

","ANSWER: <p>Yes this is a valid solution. You can simplify this by first noting, from Pascal&#39;s triangle, that:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\binom{2n}{0} + \binom{2n}{1} + ... + \binom{2n}{2n} = 2^{2n}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, we see that $$\binom{2n}{0} = \binom{2n}{2n}$$, $$\binom{2n}{1} = \binom{2n}{2n-1}$$, etc. so the above simplifies to:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$(\binom{2n}{0} + \binom{2n}{2n}) + (\binom{2n}{1} + \binom{2n}{2n-1}) + ... + \binom{2n}{n} = 2^{2n}$$</p>
<p>$$2 \cdot \binom{2n}{0} + 2 \cdot \binom{2n}{1} + ... + 2 \cdot \binom{2n}{n-1} + \binom{2n}{n} = 2^{2n}$$</p>
<p>$$2 \cdot \left( \binom{2n}{0} + \binom{2n}{1} + \ldots + \binom{2n}{n-1} \right) = 2^{2n} - \binom{2n}{n}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And thus, $$\binom{2n}{0} + \binom{2n}{1} + \ldots + \binom{2n}{n-1} = \frac{2^{2n} - \binom{2n}{n}}{2}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So then your final answer would become $$\frac{\frac{2^{2n} - \binom{2n}{n}}{2}}{2^{2n}} = \frac{2^{2n} - \binom{2n}{n}}{2^{2n+1}}$$ which is the correct answer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your answers should <strong>always be in closed form</strong> unless we explicitly mention that open form solutions are allowed.</p>

"QUESTION: <p>So sorry, but I think that I am having trouble with understanding Q1&#39;s answer/logic. I know that we are pigeonholing on the values of the codomain, but don&#39;t see how this guarantees f(1) = g(1)? Is the pigeonhole H where all functions in this hole have all their domain values are mapped to the codomain value 1 (or 2 or 3 WLOG)? Or would someone mind pointing me to the question that I remember we did that was similar to this in either one of the lectures or extra practice problems, if they can remember it?</p>
","ANSWER: <p>No need to apologize -- I agree that the wording of Q1 is a bit odd. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The argument here is that we have $$3^3 = 27$$ possible functions, and we will assign them to holes based on where they &#34;send&#34; the value 1. That is, we will have holes labeled 0, 1, and 2 (for the three possible values of the codomain, and for a function $$f$$ (which is a pigeon), it will be placed in the hole labeled $$f(1)$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By PHP, you we can conclude that there exists a hole with at least $$\lceil \frac{27}{3} \rceil = 9$$ pigeons (functions) in it. But we notice that for two functions $$f$$ and $$g$$ to be in the same hole, it must be the case that $$f(1) = g(1)$$. In other words, suppose we have two functions $$f$$ and $$g$$ that both landed in hole (WLOG) 0. Then, by construction, it MUST be that we had $$f(1) = 0$$ and $$g(1) = 0$$, so we can say that $$f(1) = g(1)$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since our hole has $$9$$ pigeons, it must be the case that the output of all of them on input $$1$$ is equal. So we take any $$9$$ of the pigeons/functions that landed in this hole.</p>

"QUESTION: <p>Since in induction we use p(k) to derive p(k&#43;1), our assumption contains some relation with k and k&#43;1 (or more). Then is it almost always the case that our base case would need to have more than just P(0)? Also, is it wrong if we just write more than one base case all the time?</p>
","ANSWER: <p>No. In ordinary induction, we almost always need only one base case. This is because we only &#34;rely&#34; on one prior term.

","ANSWER: <p>This is because we want to prove it for all $$n \geq 1$$ and the recurrence is defined for all $$n \geq 1$$.

","ANSWER: <p>We are just doing PIE to get the parenthetical part. We have:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$|B_1 \cup ... \cup B_n| = \sum_i |B_i| - \sum_{i, j} |B_i \cap B_j| + \sum_{i, j, k} |B_i \cap B_j \cap B_k| - \ldots + \sum_{1..n} |B_1 \cap B_2 \cap ... \cap B_n|$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>Consider, for example, the third summation of $$\sum_{i, j, k} |B_i \cap B_j \cap B_k|$$. In words, for a single $$i, j, k$$, we have that $$B_i \cap B_j \cap B_k$$ being the permutations in which $$h_i$$ <strong>does </strong>appear in position $$i$$, $$h_j$$ <strong>does </strong>appear in position $$j$$, and $$h_k$$ <strong>does </strong>appear in position $$k$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To find this cardinality, we do a simple counting procedure:</p>
<p>Step 1: Place $$h_i, h_j, h_k$$ in positions $$i, j, k$$ respectively (1 way)</p>
<p>Step 2: Arrange the remaining elements ($$(n-3)!$$ ways)</p>
<p></p>
<p>So for a <strong>single </strong>$$i, j, k$$, we have $$|B_i \cap B_j \cap B_k| = (n-3)!$$. For the summation term , we have $$\sum_{i, j, k} |B_i \cap B_j \cap B_k| = \sum_{i, j, k} (n-3)!$$. The question is, how many $$i, j, k$$ triples are there? Well, there are $$\binom{n}{3} = \frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So this summation term reduces to $$\frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!} \cdot (n-3)! = \frac{n!}{3!}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can do a similar thing for all of the other summations, plug it back into the PIE equation, and factor out an $$n!$$, and you will get the desired expression.</p>

"QUESTION: I wonder if it would be possible to prove this with induction on the number of strings? Thank you so much
","ANSWER: Yep induction would be possible albeit a bit overkill.

You’d realize that the induction proof and the solution we have provided have high overlap.

","ANSWER: <p>This only works for $$P_4$$. You should try drawing it out and seeing the bijection. If $$P_4$$ is the graph $$V = \{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\}$$ and $$E = \{(v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3), (v_3, v_4)\}$$, then the complement is the graph with vertex set $$V' = \{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\}$$ and edges $$E' = \{(v_1, v_3), (v_1, v_4), (v_2, v_4)\}$$.</p>

"QUESTION: <p>In a tree $$G=(V,E)$$ (undirected), adding one more edge will result in a cycle, by the minimally acyclic property (and hopefully we don&#39;t have to prove this on the final...?).

<p></p>
<p>Related, if a connected undirected graph with $$n$$ vertices has exactly $$k$$ cycles, does such a graph have exactly $$k$$ extra edges compared to its spanning tree?</p>
<p></p>
<p>This question is inspired by Final Review Q11 for reference</p>
","ANSWER: <p>It is NOT true that with each edge we add, the number of cycles in $$G$$ will increase by exactly 1. Take, for example, $$G = (V, E)$$ with $$V = \{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\}$$ and $$E = \{(v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3), (v_3, v_4)$$. This graph is a tree with zero cycles. Adding the edge $$(v_4, v_1)$$ creates a single cycle. However, if we were to add another edge (while still including $$(v_4, v_1)$$), say $$(v_1, v_3)$$, then the resulting graph has $$3$$ cycles.</p>

"QUESTION: When counting the cases where the two tigers are together, what is the difference between just assigning them first to a cage and permuting the remaining bag vs seeing the two tigers as one and permuting 24 &#34;tigers&#34; into 5 cages where one can hold 4?
","ANSWER: the second case leads to overcounting
"
"QUESTION: If the review session about Trees, it was mentioned that we can arbitrarily assign a root to trees when determining something about them. Can this be done in the induction proof instead of using an arbitrary leaf?
","ANSWER: yeah
"
"QUESTION: If we have to do induction on our exam, can we write the IH by stating &#39;assume P(k) for...&#39; or do we have to write out the proposition in words?
","ANSWER: You can do &#34;assume P(k)...&#34; so long as you explicitly define what P(k) is
"
"QUESTION: For which induction problems do we need to remove than add a certain vertex or edge?
","ANSWER: You should almost always consider the $$k+1$$ case, then reduce to the $$k$$ case, apply the IH, then reintroduce to get back to $$k+1$$

"QUESTION: <p>Proving: G is a graph s.t every vertex has degree at-least 2. Prove G contains a cycle.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Is this a valid proof as opposed to doing a proof by maximal path?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Can we assume towards contradiction that G does not have a cycle. Then in our assumption G is connected and a-cyclic, meaning that is is a tree. We know (proven in lecture) that every tree has at-least two leaves( nodes with degree 1)....... this is a contradiction as every vertex has degree 2.... meaning there is a cycle in G</p>
<p></p>
<p>.....</p>
<p>Does this proof make sense? Just relying on the fact that all trees have at-least 2 leaves?</p>
","ANSWER: seems like you figured it out in @1670_f1

"QUESTION: If we want to distribute n stars to r people but we want all of them to have at least 1 star and exactly 3 of them to have at least 2 stars, how do we solve the problem? Also, what would happen if it was at least 3 people instead of exactly 3?
","ANSWER: <p>If there are $$n$$ people, and exactly 3 of them must have at least 2 star and the remaining $$n-3$$ people must have at least one star, then it must be the case that the $$n-3$$ people all have exactly one star. So give those people all one star, then do stars &amp; bars with the remaining stars amongst the 3 people left. </p>
<p></p>
<p>For the second question, you could probably do some complementary counting PIE type stuff.</p>

"QUESTION: Is an edgeless subgraph of a graph containing all the vertices a spanning subgraph? If we have k vertices, then would the number of spanning subgraphs be 2^k?
","ANSWER: Yes to the first question. If you have $$k$$ <strong>edges</strong>, then the number of spanning subgraphs would be $$2^k$$
