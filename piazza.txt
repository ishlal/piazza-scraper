<article class="question">
<p>hi im just a little bit confused on the difference between the set &#39;belongs to&#39; another set and the set is a &#39;subset&#39; of another set</p>
<p></p>
<p>so the &#39;belongs to&#39; for a set is only referring to one element and whether that element is present in the set,</p>
<p></p>
<p>while for the &#39;subset&#39; part it is when you consider a whole set and see if that whole set is within another set?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>Your definition for &#34;belongs to&#34; is correct.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One way of thinking about &#34;subset&#34; is &#34;A is a subset of B if every element of A is also an element of B&#34;. So for example, if $$A = \{1, 2\}$$ and $$B = \{1, 2, 3\}$$, then $$A \subseteq B$$, because every element of A is also an element of B. But if $$A = \{1, 4\}$$ and $$B = \{1, 2, 3\}$$ then $$A \nsubseteq B$$</p>
</article>
<p>Response Time: 0:01:38</p>
<article class="question">
<p>ok that makes sense, i know for the set itself order does not matter, so for something to be considered a subset that order does not matter either as long as the elements are in the whole set</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>correct. So in my example, we can say $$\{1, 2\} \subseteq \{1, 2, 3\}$$ but it is also true that $$\{2, 1\} \subseteq \{1, 2, 3\}$$</p>

<article class="question">
<p>Currently, I&#39;m trying to explore possible ways to solve this question with the 2^9 = 512 hint in mind. </p>
<p></p>
<p>One avenue is powerset (P(S) with cardinality defined as 2^n), though I&#39;m not sure what using that would mean. The subsets would be all the possible combinations of elements in S. I thought about setting up the nine TAs as the nine elements, but that doesn&#39;t seem particularly useful.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The other option I&#39;m juggling at the moment is more of a Step 1, Step 2, etc. based approach like the one we saw in lecture on Thursday. I originally thought of constructing a binary tree (9 rounds and two options per round - faulty fork or no faulty fork which would&#39;ve come out to 512 total permutations). I quickly realized this also makes no sense (it&#39;s redundant - why do the 8 other TAs need to check the fork if TA #1 already determined its status?). </p>

<p>Am I missing something here or am I assuming something wrong with my current two approaches? </p>

<p>Title: Procedure that&#39;s not multiplication rule</p>
<article class="question">
<p>In the Lecture example: &#34;How many odd numbers between 1000 and 9999 have distinct digits?&#34; </p>
<p>why does the multiplication rule still apply? For example, the number of ways performing step 4 depends upon whether a zero was chosen in the earlier steps.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Also in the president, secretary, treasurer question, the solution says multiplication rule does not apply because outcome of prior step changes later # outcomes. What&#39;s the logic that distinguishes the approaches to these two questions? </p>
<p></p>
<p>Is it that within a question with multiple ways of performing the steps, only one sequence of steps allows multiplication rule to be applied and other sequences of events do not? thank you.</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>Note that only Attempt 3 shows a correct solution for the &#34;odd numbers&#34; question. In that attempt, we can see that we will not select the number zero in steps 1 and 2. Only the second digit and the third digit can be zeroes, which is why they are placed last in our ordering of steps. But these steps also acknowledge the fact that, for example, the second digit cannot be the same as the first or fourth digit (whose digits have already been chosen), which is why there are 10 - 2 = 8 ways to perform step 3. And similar logic holds for step 4.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure I completely understand your second question, but I&#39;ll try my best to give some information that may clear things up. Steps within your process that you develop for counting CAN depend on each other, but we can only perform MR when each step has a CONSTANT number of ways of being performed. For example, in attempt 1 of the &#34;secretary&#34; question, the third step can be performed in 2 ways if, for example, Bob is President and Ann is Treasurer, 1 way if, for example, Bob is president and Clyde is secretary, or 0 ways if, for example, Clyde is president and Dan is secretary. Since this is NOT a constant value, the MR can&#39;t really be used.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Whereas, in attempt 2, since we chose the secretary first, the remaining two steps always have the same constant number of people to choose from.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For your last question, no. There can be many ways of ordering the steps. You just need to be sure that the ordering of the steps meets the above rule of that constant value for each step.</p>
<p></p>
<p>hope that made a bit of sense!</p>

<p>You should avoid doing this for sets. This is because sets are an unordered collection of values. For something like sequences (which is something we don&#39;t cover in this class), the elements have order and we can use a recursive definition.</p>

<p>Well not quite. The reason we can say that if $$k \in \mathbb{N}$$ then $$k+2 \in \mathbb{N}$$ is because $$\mathbb{N}$$ is closed under addition. Since in your example, we are transitioning from $$\mathbb{N}$$ to $$\mathbb{Z^+}$$, we can&#39;t quite use the same reason, because they are different sets.

<md>The definition of odd and even, stated in 1T, 
$$n \text{ is even} \iff \exists k\in \mathbb{Z} \text{ such that } n=2k$$ and  $$n \text{ is odd} \iff \exists k\in\mathbb{Z} \text{ such that } n=2k+1$$.

<p>When disproving universal claims via counterexample, if I &#34;guessed and checked&#34; and found a counterexample out of luck/intuition, is it fine to say that I happened to find a counterexample, which disproved the claim? Or should I still resort to breaking down the claim into basic parts? (Example: the claim is that all (odd &#43; even) yields even integers. if I just try 3 &#43; 6 = 9, I have already found a counterexample. but I don&#39;t know if &#34;guessing and checking&#34; is a rigorous purpose for finding the counterexample, so should I go further and rewrite odd &#43; even with their definitions (2k &#43; 1) and (2m) and show how you always get an odd integer from 2(k &#43; m) &#43; 1, hence breaking the claim into basic parts?)</p>

</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>Ahh! Thanks!</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>Can you explain why 4 · 26^3 is incorrect? </p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>Sure. The procedure to get this answer is as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Step 1: Choose one spot to place the x</p>
<p>Step 2: Choose a letter for one of the remaining spots</p>
<p>Step 3: Choose a letter for one of the remaining spots</p>
<p>Step 4: Choose a letter for the last available spot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let&#39;s consider two <strong>distinct</strong> &#34;paths&#34; through this procedure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Suppose in step 1, I place the x in the first slot. Now, in step 2, let&#39;s suppose we are looking at the second slot, and suppose we happen to choose the letter x for that slot as well. In step 3, suppose we place a y in the third slot. And suppose in step 4, we place a z in the last slot. Then the string we have constructed is &#34;xxyz&#34;.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, suppose in step 1, I place the x in the <strong>second</strong> slot. Now, in step 2, we find an available slot and choose a letter for it. So suppose we look at the first slot and happen to choose the letter x. In step 3, suppose we place a y in the third slot. And suppose in step 4, we place a z in the last slot. Then the string we have constructed is again &#34;xxyz&#34;.<br /><br />So we see that we have constructed the same string twice by following <strong>distinct </strong>&#34;paths&#34; in the procedure. This is an indication that we have overcounted, and the answer is incorrect.</p>

How is the spacing between the n special points? Are the points evenly spaced or randomly spaced? <br /><div><div><br /></div></div>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>They are arranged in a way so as to not have multiple lines intersecting at the same point. So to answer your question, they are neither evenly spaced (because this would lead to multiple lines intersecting at the same point) nor are they randomly spaced (because this does not guarantee avoiding multiple lines intersecting at the same point).</p>

<p>Title: Disprove using one example</p>
<article class="question">
In one of the other questions, I saw that you can disprove a statement using one counterexample; does that also apply for disproving a set equality? I.e. If I wanna prove A = B have to prove that A and B are subsets of each other, then if I found one case in A \subseteq B where this isn’t true, is it sufficiently proving that A ≠ B? thanks.
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>Yes, showing $$A \nsubseteq B$$ would prove that $$A \neq B$$. Often, the easiest way to do this is to find some $$x \in A$$ such that $$x \notin B$$.</p>

<p>Title: Trying to understand distinguishable vs indistinguishable</p>
<article class="question">
<p>Hi, I was wondering how question 3 from the homework would be different if the cars were indistinguishable. I&#39;m thinking that it would be 8 choose 3, but I&#39;m not too sure. Could I please get some insight? Thank you!</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>As an example, suppose three of the cars are called $$A$$, $$B$$ and $$C$$ (distinguishable), and suppose the three interests are called $$x$$, $$y$$, and $$z$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then one possible distribution of these cars would be $$A$$ to $$x$$, $$B$$ to $$y$$ and $$C$$ to $$z$$. But clearly, there are many more ways to distribute the cars.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If, however, the cars were indistinguishable, then we could all give them the same name of $$A$$. And the <span style="text-decoration:underline">only</span> way to distribute the cars now would be $$A$$ to $$x$$, $$A$$ to $$y$$ and $$A$$ to $$z$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>As a reminder, <strong>ALL</strong> eight cars must be distributed amongst his interests.</p>
</article>
<p>Response Time: 0:06:43</p>
<article class="question">
<p>Oh, interesting. The way in which i was doing it I don&#39;t think all the cars were being distributed?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here&#39;s the procedure that I created for indistinguishable:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Contestant 1 gets a car: 8 possibilites</p>
<p>Contestant 2 gets a car: 8 possibilites</p>
<p>Contestant 3 gets a car: 8 possibilites</p>
<p></p>
<p>Contestant 1 gets 0 cars: 8^2 possibilites</p>
<p>Contestant 2 gets 0 cars: 8^2 possibilites</p>
<p>Contestant 3 gets 0 cars: 8^2 possibilites</p>
<p></p>
<p>Contestant 1 gets all cars: 1 possibility</p>
<p>Contestant 2 gets all cars: 1 possibility</p>
<p>Contestant 3 gets all cars: 1 possibility</p>
<p></p>
<p>So the total ways would be 8^3 - (3 x 8^2 - 3)?</p>

<p>I understand that, but I was just wondering since this is a not exactly a homework problem as I have changed the conditions for the problem and created a new hypothetical scenario to clarify the difference between indistinguishable and distinguishable. No worries though, I appreciate it.</p>

In Q3, how do I make sure that the ordering of cars, ordering of contestants, and placing of the dividers are independent steps? Is that guaranteed by the symmetry of the tree of possibilities (i.e. for each x, there are y number of ways and for each of that way there are z number of ways)? If so, can we use that as our justification in in the hw? thanks.

<p>I&#39;m not really sure what you mean by &#34;dividers&#34;, but regardless, it seems like you are already far along in your thought process for this problem, so it may be a better idea to visit office hours to discuss that thought process with a TA in person.

<article class="question">
<p>Hi! I have an approach for question 2 that I&#39;m not so sure about. I&#39;m pretty much representing a three-way venn diagram as sets. For example, let set A contain only silver dresses, set B contains only silver/tan dresses, set E contains only silver/tan/red dresses, and set D contains only silver/red dresses. Each of these sets can be empty. Then, let set S represent sets that contain tan dresses, so that S = {A, B, D, E}. Is this rigorous enough to go through the questions and do actual operations on?</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>These Venn Diagram-esque approaches are good for gaining insight into what the sets will look like after the operations are performed on them, but do not suffice as a rigorous proof. For this, it may be a good idea to reference the lecture notes to see what a more rigorous proof would look like.</p>

<article class="answer">
<p>nah you don&#39;t need to cancel them out. So something like $$\binom{10}{3} \cdot \binom{5}{2} \cdot \binom{7}{6}$$ would be a fine final answer.</p>

If that is not enough, you are probably on the wrong track. You don't have to consider too much about this...

If you need more you can generate them with this python code:

```python
from math import sin, cos, radians
from turtle import Turtle, done, tracer, update

turtle = Turtle()
radius = 300
sides = 10

def init():
    tracer(0, 0)
    turtle.speed(0)
    turtle.hideturtle()
    turtle.penup()
    turtle.pensize(5)
    turtle.goto(0,-radius)
    turtle.pendown()
    turtle.circle(radius)
    turtle.penup()
    turtle.pensize(10/sides)
def get_points(x):
    angles = [2**(-_)*360 for _ in range(x)]
    return [(sin(_)*radius,
             cos(_)*radius)
            for _ in angles]
def draw_line(point1,point2):
    turtle.penup()
    turtle.goto(*point1)
    turtle.pendown()
    turtle.goto(*point2)
    turtle.penup()
def draw_lines(x):
    points = get_points(x)
    for point1 in points:
        for point2 in points:
            if point1 != point2:
                draw_line(point1, point2)
def main():
    init()
    draw_lines(sides)
    update()
    done()

main()
```

<article class="question">
How does this word influence how we do counting?
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>Let&#39;s consider two similar questions:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Question 1: How many ways are there to give two <strong>distinguishable</strong> watches to two distinguishable people such that each person gets a watch.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Solution: Let $$A$$ be the first watch and $$B$$ be the second watch. Let $$X$$ be the first person and let $$Y$$ be the second person. Then we have two distributions: $$((A, X), (B, Y))$$ and $$((A, Y), (B, X)$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Question 2: How many ways are there to give two <strong>indistinguishable </strong>watches to two distinguishable people such that each person gets a watch.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Solution: Now, we <strong>cannot</strong> call our watches $$A$$ and $$B$$ because they are indistinguishable. Instead, we will call them both $$A$$. If our people are $$X$$ and $$Y$$, then we only have one distribution: $$((A, X), (A, Y))$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In a sense, &#34;distinguishable&#34; allows for more variety in our cases/distributions.</p>

<article class="question">
<p>Do we need to prove that switching order of operations without parentheses is okay? For example, if X = A \cup B \cap C, X = A \cap C \cup B is also true? </p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>It is not always true that $$A \cup B \cap C = A \cap C \cup B$$ because parentheses are needed to avoid ambiguity.</p>

<article class="question">
<p>What if there are no parentheses?</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>Then it&#39;s ambiguous because you wouldn&#39;t know whether to perform the union or intersection first.</p>

<p>Because $$a^2$$ and $$2b^2$$ represent the same number. Suppose we let $$p=a^2$$ and $$p = 2b^2$$, which follows from the fact that $$a^2 = 2b^2$$.

<p>Title: Q2</p>
<article class="question">
<p>For my proof for Q2, I have shown that for every value of c, sqrt(a) is irrational. I am trying to state that proving this for every value of c is sufficient because every possible value that sqrt(a) can take on corresponds to a value of c. I am able to show that every possible value of a corresponds to a value of c, as a must necessarily be equal to 19c^2 for some value of c. Would I just be able to state that every possible value of sqrt(a) corresponds to some value a, to then transitively show that every possible value of sqrt(a) corresponds to some value of c, and thus showing that all values of c result in sqrt(a) being irrational is sufficient to show that all values of sqrt(a) are irrational? </p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>You are allowed to assume $$\sqrt{a} = \sqrt{b}$$ if and only if $$a = b$$. How you choose to use this fact in your solution is up to you.</p>

<article class="question">
<p>Would I be able to assume that $$\sqrt{a}$$ never takes on some value that does not correspond to a?</p>

<p>probably not, just because of how loosely defined &#34;correspond&#34; is. Try utilizing math to &#34;define&#34; the correspondence, and from there, potentially use the fact that I provided above, if needed.</p>

<p>Title: Q7</p>
<article class="question">
<p>I&#39;m a bit confused by Q7 because it seems to me that parts a and b are asking the same thing. My rationale is that if Max wants to have all the creatures in Justin&#39;s list, there is only one way to do that, plus the &#34;extra&#34; elements that he can add to his own list (the creatures in his list that aren&#39;t in Justin&#39;s list). So isn&#39;t the solutions for parts a and b the same or am I missing something? </p>
</article>

<p>No. But they <strong>can </strong>be identical in part a. This suggests that you should also consider the extra creatures in part a.</p>

<p>Title: Multiset Question</p>
<article class="question">
<p>This is more related to lecture but I am confused about this phrase in the lecture notes: </p>
<p></p>
<p>&#34;In other words, we want to find the number of ways there are to choose a multiset of r elements from a multiset of n distinct elements with infinite copies of each of the n elements available&#34;</p>
<p></p>
<p>How are we choosing a multiset from another multiset? Can you provide an example if possible? Thanks. </p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>A multiset is defined to be a set where elements can repeat. So if we are looking at a multiset that has repeats, and we want to select a subset of items, sometimes we would want repeats in that subset (hence, we would want to obtain a multiset).</p>
<p></p>
<p>A good example is the book example in the lecture notes, where in our 6 book selection, we will have repeats. </p>
</article>
<p>Response Time: 0:29:49</p>
<article class="question">
<p>In that example I don&#39;t understand intuitevly where 6&#43;3-1 is coming from. </p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>To clarify, I am asking why it makes sense that there are 8 possible locations to place a divider? I am counting only 5 (a divider in between two crosses). </p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>I think the best way to explain this is to consider an arrangement of sticks and crosses. So for example, let&#39;s look at **|*|***. Each &#34;section&#34; corresponds to a type of book (and there are three types of books). Each star represents a book (or rather, a count of the amount of books in the category). So the arrangement I provided says that there are 2 books of type 1, 1 book of type 2 and 3 books of type 3. A single arrangement of books can uniquely be represented by one of these strings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We need 6 &#34;crosses&#34; to represent the 6 books that we need, and we need (3-1) = 2 dividers, so that&#39;s why we have $$\binom{6 + 3 - 1}{6}$$</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>Sorry, but I am still confused about why intuitevly 8 choose 6 makes sense. We are trying to choose 6 books out of 8 of what? Why is it 8? Why are the dividers included in the total? </p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>8 is the total amount of books and dividers needed. In order to uniquely describe a selection of books, you need a &#34;string&#34; similar to the one I provided **|*|***, where there are 6 crosses and 2 sticks. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Instead of thinking of the 6 as &#34;choosing 6 books&#34;, it may be helpful to think of it as you have 8 spaces (where you need to place books and dividers), and you are choosing the locations to put the books.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Notice that $$\binom{6 + 3 - 1}{6} = \binom{6 + 3 -1}{3 - 1}$$, so in a similar mindset, we could instead choose the locations for the dividers, and the books will go in the remaining spaces.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We need to include the dividers, because otherwise, we have no separation of the books, because we would be treating all books as indistinguishable.</p>

<p>Title: Is this a valid proof by contradiction?</p>
<article class="question">
<p>Let&#39;s say the claim is <strong>t</strong><strong>he sum is even. </strong>If I want to prove the claim by contradiction, we assume that the sum is odd. If my contradiction is that I showed that the sum will be even (contradicting the assumption), is this considered proof by contradiction? Or is this redundant/unnecessary because I am simply proving that the sum is even directly? </p>
<p></p>
<p>Basically, for a specific problem, I just think it&#39;s easier and clearer to understand if I prove a claim by initially assuming the opposite and thus everything that assumption implies. Then with those implications and the rest of the context of the problem show that the original claim is true. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Hopefully, my question is clear (I tried my best haha) and I can get some guidance! </p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>This really depends on the proof. Most of the times when doing contradiction, we end up contradicting something true that was given in the problem, though in some instances, you may end up contradicting what you assumed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you find yourself often proving the opposite of what you assumed, then it may be best to just stick with a direct proof.</p>

<p>$$p \implies q$$ is not logically equivalent to $$\neg p \implies q$$. In general, when doing contradiction, you assume $$\neg q$$ to be true. </p>

<p>One way of thinking about the first part is consider you have some value $$m$$. From there, you consider every single prime $$\leq \sqrt{m}$$. If none of these primes divide $$m$$, then (this is the second part of claim), $$m$$ must be prime.</p>

<p>I am confused on what the negation of p would actually be then.

<article class="question">
<p>Are we supposed to solve Q5 not using the fact that the sum 1&#43;...&#43;n  is n(n&#43;1)/2? </p>
<p></p>
<p>I have proved both of these questions in high school, second after the first using the first as a lemma. Right now I tried to prove the second normally by induction without using the above-mentioned fact. </p>
<p></p>
<p>As usual, I get to the step where I substitute the induction hypothesis and I have </p>
<p></p>
<p>(1&#43;2&#43;...&#43;k)^2 &#43; (k&#43;1)^3</p>
<p></p>
<p>I tried to show that it equals to (1&#43;2&#43;...&#43;k&#43;(k&#43;1))^2 algebraically for the last few hours but I can&#39;t do it. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Alternatively, If I use the lemma I get (k(k&#43;1)/2)^2 &#43;(k&#43;1)^3 and I know how to get the required form from there to finish the proof. </p>
<p></p>
<p>So my question is, are we expected to figure it out algebraically somehow or are we expected to just prove the lemma first and then prove the main claim using the lemma here? </p>
<p></p>
<p>My reasoning was that as there is nothing in question about doing it via proving 1&#43;...&#43;n = n(n&#43;1)/2 first, we should be able to do it without using this fact, but now after 4h of trying I am not sure anymore...</p>

<article class="question">
<p>What is the different between saying &#34;without loss of generality&#34; and &#34;arbitrary but particular&#34;? When would we use each?</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>&#34;Without loss of generality&#34; is commonly used when making a claim for some variables. For example, I would say something like &#34;suppose $$a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$$, and without loss of generality, let $$a < b$$&#34;. And then I would do whatever math needed. In the instance that $$b < a$$, I wouldn&#39;t have to do any math because the &#34;symmetric&#34; argument is covered with &#34;Without Loss of Generality&#34;. That is to say, we can&#39;t just be throwing around WLOG whenever we want. We should only use it when the argument truly is symmetric.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#34;Arbitrary but Particular&#34; is usually used when describing an element of a set. We use this to indicate that there is &#34;nothing special&#34; about the element, and the argument for that element will hold for all elements of the set.</p>

What is the procedure for negating a statement like &#34;if there is no prime number p such that $$p \leq m$$ and $$p | m$$?&#34; Would I only negate the first part (i.e., there <em>is</em> a prime number p), or would I negate &#34;and&#34; between $$p \leq m$$ and $$p | m$$? Or is it something else entirely, such as negating the math expressions to $$\geq$$ and $$\nmid$$? Thank you for your help with this.</p>

<p>Title: m must be a prime negation (q2)</p>
<article class="question">
<p>What is the negation of m must be a prime? is it m does not have to be a prime or m must not be a prime?</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>Note that the question can be rephrased (without losing any meaning) as &#34;... if there is no prime $$p$$ such that $$p \leq \sqrt{m}$$ and $$p \mid m$$, <strong>then $$m$$ is prime&#34;</strong>.</p>

<p>Title: Question About Contrapositive</p>
<article class="question">
<p>Hi! I was wondering if we have P s.t. A and B implies Q, would the contrapositive be:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. -Q implies -P s.t. A and B</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>2. -Q implies -P s.t. A or B</p>
<p></p>
<p>Because the statement is about P, and st A and B are descriptions of P, would it not use demorgans law? Im thinking of HW 3H question 2.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>Our solutions for 3H are now posted on Canvas, so you can take a look at them now.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But in general, you can try to simplify a complex statement. So for example, the &#34;if...then...&#34; statement in Q2 is quite complex, but it can be boiled down to: &#34;if there is no prime $$p$$ such that XYZ conditions hold, then $$m$$ is prime&#34;.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The contrapositive would be &#34;If $$m$$ is not prime, then there <strong>is</strong> a prime $$p$$ such that XYZ conditions hold.&#34;</p>

<p>Title: Q2 - Closed form?</p>
<article class="question">
<md>Hi! Just wondering, would saying something like this be closed form?

* If $$k = 1$$ and $$r = 1$$, the answer is 1.
* If $$k = 1$$ and $$r > 1$$, the answer is 0.
* Otherwise, the answer is some combinatorial expression that I haven't found yet but I'm pretty sure would break if $$k = 1$$.

The root cause of this is that if $$k = 1$$, the only color to choose from would be the golden block, which I don't think I can use something like stars-and-bars with.

Thanks!</md>

<article class="question">
<md>Hi there! This question is more appropriate for office hours than here, but I waited in the office hours line for two hours today, and had to leave for a meeting, so I wasn't able to get help. Since I'm pretty stuck and there's no other way to get help before the homework is due, I'm asking here. I'm very sorry if that isn't okay. 

For Q3, I'm trying to come up with the appropriate question. I can see that the right side can be used to either make a question about an m-multiset of the union of two disjoint sets of size m and n, or the number of permutations in a multiset with m of one element and n of another. However, I’m absolutely stuck on the left side. I can see that it's probably the summation of some kind of partitioned set and that it’s somewhat similar to the formula for the permutations of a multiset with infinite elements of a certain number of types, but other than that I’m lost.</md>
</article>
<article class="answer">
yeah this is a question that is hard to answer on piazza and better suited for OH. My best advice is to determine how you want to do the partition, which may be derived from any special characteristics you find about the things you count on the RHS.<div><br /></div><div>It may also be helpful to note that the bottom part of the “choose” on the LHS is m-1 instead of the m on the RHS</div>

<p>Title: Any tips for designing a combinatorial proof</p>
<article class="question">
<p>How does one make a good counting question that can be used for a combinatorial proof, and what are some useful techniques? I noticed that the question is usually made from the simpler side of the identity to be proven, and the more complicated side is derived from partitioning the choices by some sort of scheme.</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>I&#39;m not the greatest at combo proofs, but I&#39;ll do my best to answer this and maybe another TA can provide their advice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The way I approach combo proofs is exactly what you outlined: I look at the easier side, and formulate a counting question based off of that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The &#34;harder&#34; side often requires a bit more creativity. There&#39;s usually some sort of system involved in counting the &#34;harder&#34; side, whether that be partitions or casework. It&#39;s also nice to do a bit of pattern recognition (like if I see a $$2^n$$ on the harder side, I might be thinking about subsets).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Really, a lot of it comes down to practice and creativity in developing different methods of solving the same counting question.</p>

<p>Title: Question 2 approach</p>
<article class="question">
<p>I&#39;ve tried using induction on n for q2 starting with the IH n=k of picking coefficients on some terms x^p and x^q as (k choose p)*5^k and (k choose q)*5^k where p and q are from 1 to k to have the same remainder in division by floor(k/2). But my issue with the induction step for k&#43;1, I am limited to analyzing the coefficients on x^p and x^q that I picked for the induction hypothesis, which doesn&#39;t have to be the case. The issue is that I just have to show that such coefficients exist anywhere in the polynomial, but I feel like induction is forcing me to carry over the previous choices of the coefficients to the next step.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Is induction the right way to go for this question? I&#39;m struggling to also make use of the floor division property algebraically.</p>

<p>For induction hypothesis, why do we say &#34;for some k&#34; instead of say &#34;for any k&#34;?</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>great question. I think this comes down to how induction is built upon the idea of proving $$P(k) \implies P(k+1) \quad \forall k$$. Since it&#39;s hard to prove that implication for all values of k, if we show the implication to be true for an arbitrary value of $$k$$, then we don&#39;t have to worry about proving it for all $$k$$, because we would have already shown that since $$k$$ was arbitrary.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since $$k$$ is arbitrary, we say &#34;for some k&#34;, since we don&#39;t really know what $$k$$ is, but we just want it to be arbitrary.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I can&#39;t quite put my finger on why &#34;for any k&#34; may be incorrect because I think there are valid arguments on both sides (for it to be logically acceptable or not). One such argument is that &#34;for any&#34; may be an implication of strong induction, but not in an accurate way. But one could also argue that &#34;for any k&#34; can mean the same thing as &#34;for some k&#34;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Given this, my recommendation is to stick with convention and to just use &#34;for some k&#34;.</p>

<p>Since $$q\geq1$$, $$p\mid P(p,q)$$, so $$P(p,q)=q!\cdot\tbinom{p}{q}$$ is a multiple of $$p$$. It must then be true that $$p\mid\tbinom{p}{q}$$, since the only prime factor of $$p$$ (which is $$p$$) cannot divide $$q!$$ when $$q\leq p-1$$. This is because prime $$p$$ shares no common prime factors with any integers less than $$p$$. Thus, for any prime $$p$$ and integer $$q$$ s.t. $$1\leq q\leq p-1$$, $$p\mid\tbinom{p}{q}$$.</p>

I&#39;m just a little lost on how to show that what is in the summation is an integer multiple of p. Not sure if its best to just go back to OH tomorrow, but I thought I would ask on here as well. </p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>showing that $$\binom{p}{j}$$ is a multiple of $$j$$ would not imply that the summand is a multiple of $$p$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Instead, try showing that it is a multiple of $$p$$ if your goal is to rewrite it as $$k + 1 + pm + p(\text{other stuff})$$. Try expanding out the $$\binom{p}{j}$$ and use what you know about $$j$$ compared to $$p$$.</p>

You could, but at that point you should just do weak induction because it is bad technique to have a strong IH and do ordinary induction in the IS.

<article class="question">
<p>But what if I dont need do?</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>then you might be better off doing a direct proof. A proof by induction requires the use of the induction hypothesis in the induction step.</p>

<article class="answer">
<p>Ya i know that but the question says, &#34;Help Brian prove this statement to be true for all n by using induction!&#34;. Is there a way to convert a direct proof into an induction proof.</p>
<p>PS - I already have a direct proof. Thus the question arises</p>
<p></p>

<p>sure, it probably is possible to do that conversion, but the way I would go about doing that is to just start an induction proof from scratch and during my induction step, try to use insights gained from my direct proof.</p>

<p>Basically the issue arises from Steps 1 and 2.</p>

<p>In step 1, we can say that there are five options for the fourth digit (namely 0, 2, 4, 6, 8). But after that, we can&#39;t quite say that for step 2, in choosing the first digit, there are only 8 options. This is because, if the digit we chose in step 1 is 0, then we actually have 9 options for the first digit.</p>

<article class="answer">
<p>Yeah, the definition is that if $$x \in \mathbb{Q}$$, then $$\exists a \in \mathbb{Z}$$ and $$\exists b \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{0\}$$ such that $$x = \frac{a}{b}$$.</p>

<p>Not necessarily for &#34;less explaining&#34;, but more so because that was actually the thing we contradicted. So you might be asking yourself, &#34;when should I add this &#39;constraint&#39;&#34;, and my answer to that would probably be most of the time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is because even though the definition with and without the constraint define the same term, without the constraint of $$a$$ and $$b$$ sharing no common factors, there are an infinite amount of choices for $$a$$ and $$b$$. Whereas, if we introduce the idea of $$a$$ and $$b$$ sharing no common factors, then there is only one such pair. </p>

<p>yeah I think it&#39;s kind of hard to incorporate permuting multisets in this, because when we do those permutations, we have very few constraints. In this problem, we introduce a lot of constraints, and while it may be possible to incorporate these constraints by modifying how we permute the multisets, it gets (arguably) equally tedious.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Casing, though sometimes tedious, is usually quite effective, so you shouldn&#39;t rule it out immediately!</p>

<p>i also don&#39;t really understand the reasoning for there being only 1 way to order the numbers in step 2.... does non-decreasing imply strictly increasing?</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
If you take any sequence of numbers, there will only be way to order them such that the permutation is non-decreasing (this is not the same as strictly increasing).  To get the intuition, try ordering some numbers with repeats and see how many ways there are to make the order non-decreasing.

<p>Title: Binomial Theorem</p>
<article class="question">
<p>In the Binomial Theorem, the notes say that a and b must be real numbers. With the 2^n example, I used (2 &#43; 0)^n and expanded using the binomial theorem. However, I didn&#39;t get the same answer as the lecture notes. Is that a fault in my calculation or should this work? </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>you can still use $$(2 + 0)^n$$, but you will arrive at something different than $$\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}$$, because when we did $$(1 + 1)^n$$, we were able to simplify nicely using the fact that $$1^m = 1$$ for any $$m$$, but we do not have that leverage when we do $$(2+0)^n$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>tldr: yeah it works, but it just gives you different information</p>
</article>
<p>Response Time: 0:04:51</p>
<article class="question">
<p>But if we do (2 &#43; 0)^n, we basically prove that 2^n = 0, which proves the claim false?</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>not quite. You get the following:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$(2+0)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} 2^{n-k}0^k = \binom{n}{0} 2^{n-0}0^0 + \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k} 2^{n-k}0^k = 1 \cdot 2^n \cdot 1 + 0 = 2^n$$</p>

<p>This is not quite a proof for the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic because that theorem also mentions that the prime factorization is unique.

<p>evenness and relatively prime are two different things. Evenness describes a single value, whereas &#34;relatively prime&#34; describes two numbers.

<p>Can you explain why you are multiplying $$4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1$$? If it&#39;s because there are &#34;four options&#34; for the first slot, and &#34;three options&#34; for the second slot, and so on, then you should be dividing by $$4!$$ because you&#39;ve already fixed the last card to be the non-four-of-a-kind.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you are doing that multiplication because of the suits, then it is important to realize that the order of the cards within a hand doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<article class="question">
<p>I am multiplying 4*3*2*1 because once we have determined the value of the four-of-a-kind, there are 4 ways to choose the first card, 3 to choose the second (only three more of the target card exists within the deck), etc.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought we could get the combinations by dividing the permutations by the number of ways to order the elements chosen to get the combinations?</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this case, I found the permutations of the 5 desired elements, then divided by 5! to get rid of the effect of permutations</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>Yeah dividing is totally okay, but only if you have actually considered all permutations of the five cards. In this case, you&#39;ve fixed the last card to be the non-four-of-a-kind, so you aren&#39;t able to divide by 5! since not all permutations have been considered.</p>

<p>yeah you can assume that. There isn&#39;t really too much to prove here because it is just a definition, but if you were to explain why the definition makes sense logically, the way you are approaching it is fine.</p>

<p>What do you mean by P(A)? If you mean powerset, then no, because it is not true that $$P(A) \cup P(B) = P(A \cup B)$$ because $$\{a, b\} \in P(A \cup B)$$ but $$\{a, b\} \notin P(A) \cup P(B)$$</p>

<p>For this example, I&#39;m a bit confused about how we came up with the probabilities for the cases where w1 = w2 and w1 does not equal w2. Could you please explain? </p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>For the outcomes where $$w_1 = w_2 = i, i \in \{1, 2, 3\}$$, three things need to occur:</p>
<ol><li>The prize is assigned to door $$i$$</li><li>The contestant chooses door $$i$$</li><li>The host opens door $$j$$ where $$j \neq i$$</li></ol>
<p></p>
<p>Let&#39;s analyze the probability of each of these:</p>
<ol><li>Since the prize is equally likely to be assigned to any of the doors, and there are $$3$$ doors, there is a $$1/3$$ chance of the prize being assigned to door $$i$$</li><li>Since the contestant is equally likely to choose any of the doors, and there are $$3$$ doors, there is a $$1/3$$ chance of the contestant choosing door $$i$$</li><li>The $$2$$ remaining doors both do not contain the prize, so the host can choose either of them. Since there are $$2$$ remaining doors and both have an equal chance of being chosen, there is a $$1/2$$ chance of the host choosing door $$j$$</li></ol>

<article class="question">
<p>For the last question about deleting a leaf, how do we know that the leaf we&#39;re deleting is not a part of any other walks besides the one its deleted from, so that the graph remains connected?</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>A leaf $$v$$, which has degree 1, can only be a part of path $$P$$ if one of $$P$$&#39;s endpoints is $$v$$. If otherwise, then suppose we have a path $$P'$$ where $$v$$ is within the path, but not one of the endpoints, then $$P' = ... - u - v - w - ....$$ which would mean that $$v$$ would have two neighbors, and hence degree 2 (contradiction).</p>
<p></p>
<p>So when we remove $$v$$, the only paths we lose are those that have endpoint $$v$$. But since $$T' = T \setminus \{v\}$$ has all vertices of $$T$$ except $$v$$, all paths between non-$$v$$ vertices in $$T$$ remain in $$T'$$, so it&#39;s connected.</p>

<p>Title: n-m connected components</p>
<article class="question">
<p>We have proven that a graph will have at least n-m connected components. However, if n=m (like a triangle) then n-m=0, which means that a graph will have at least 0 connected components. What does this mean? What if m&gt;n, so n-m&lt;0? What does that mean then?</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>That fact is basically saying if $$|V| = n$$ and $$|E| = m$$, then $$|CC| \geq n - m$$, where we use the notation $$|CC|$$ to denote the number of connected components.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the case when $$n = m$$, then you can conclude that a graph has at least $$0$$ connected components, which is not too groundbreaking of a conclusion. In general, this fact does not give us much information when $$m \geq n$$, because you can always construct a connected graph with $$n$$ vertices and $$m$$ edges when $$m \geq n$$, and such a connected graph would only have $$1$$ connected component. This fact is more useful when $$m < n$$.</p>

<p>Can we assume that the roads/routes are indistinguishable in the sense that if you had n points and had to place x routes in between them, those x routes are indistinguishable? </p>

<article class="answer">
<p>I wouldn&#39;t really call them indistinguishable, since the &#34;points&#34; are distinguishable. And since a route connects two points, one could define a route by the points it connects.</p>

<p>For q5, what does it mean for there to be <em>exactly</em> one such loop if and only if there are n routes? Like would the loops within V = {v_1, v_2 … v_n }, E = {(v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3), (v_3, v_4)… (v_n, v_1)} and V = {v_1, v_2 … v_n } E’ = {(v_1, v_4), (v_4, v_2), (v_3, v_4)… (v_n, v_1)} be the same?</p>

<article class="question">
<p>I feel like i still don&#39;t fully understand. For both couldn&#39;t you pair each edge to exactly one vertex, like for this graph with 4 vertices |{(v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3), (v_3, v_4), (v_4, v_1)}| = 4 = |{(v_1, v_3), (v_3, v_2), (v_2, v_4), (v_4, v_1)}</p>

<article class="answer">
<p>you have just enumerated <strong>two different </strong>graphs because the edge sets are different. Both of these graphs have $$n$$ vertices and $$n$$ routes, and they both have exactly one loop. But the main thing to note is that they are different graphs.</p>

<p>Does the definition of a leaf change depending on rooted trees vs normal trees?</p>

<p>yeah I made a mistake in @1174. There exists some literature in which a leaf is defined as only having degree 1. But according to this class&#39;s lecture notes, &#34;A vertex of degree greater than 1 in a tree is called an internal vertex, <strong>otherwise it is called a leaf</strong>&#34;.</p>

<p>Title: Question 6</p>
<article class="question">
<p>Question 6 asks us to prove that you can get from one store in A to another store in B if and only if you can get from any record store to any other record store. Isn&#39;t this just the definition of a connected graph? I&#39;m really confused about what this question is really asking, because it seems like by definition the claim is already satisfied.</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>It&#39;s not just that &#34;you can get from one store in A to another store in B&#34;, but rather, &#34;you can get from one store in A to another store in B <strong>using a single road&#34;</strong>.</p>
</article>
<p>Response Time: 0:02:36</p>
<article class="question">
<p>but doesn&#39;t that still follow from the definition of a connected graph? I&#39;m assuming a single road is equivalent to a single unique path</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>this depends on how you construct your graph.</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>so could you clarify a bit on what &#34;a single road&#34; means? does it mean it could be either an edge OR a path?</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>Again, this depends on how you construct your graph. If edges represent roads, then &#34;a single road&#34; would mean a single edge. </p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;m still a bit lost. If I chose to construct a road as a path instead of an edge, then wouldn&#39;t the proof automatically be satisfied? is there leeway in how paths/edges can be constructed? </p>

<article class="question">
<p>Conceptually why are the following not equal? Because don&#39;t they both result in picking p&#43;1 objects from n objects?</p>
<p></p>
<p>expression 1: (n choose p) * (n-p choose 1)</p>
<p>expression 2: (n choose p&#43;1)</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I expanded both expressions out, they are not equal, but I&#39;m having a hard time understanding why this is the case.</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>This overcounts. Consider the counting question: &#34;From $$n$$ distinct elements, choose $$p+1$$ of them&#34;. Expression 2 clearly answers this question. We would think that we could construct a counting procedure in that we &#34;select p elements&#34; in step one and then &#34;select 1&#34; in the second step. But this will overcount some cases.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, suppose $$n = 4$$ and $$p = 2$$. And suppose our elements are $$\{A, B, C, D\}$$. Then we have to select $$p + 1 = 3$$ elements. So suppose in step one, where we select $$p = 2$$ elements, we choose $$A$$ and $$B$$. And suppose in step two, where we &#34;select one&#34; of the remaining, we select $$C$$. Then, our collection is $$\{A, B, C\}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But we could instead in step 1 select $$A$$ and $$C$$. And then in step $$2$$ we could select $$B$$, so our collection would be $$\{A, B, C\}$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>So we&#39;ve obtained the same collection in two different ways from the counting procedure which indicates that we overcounted.</p>

<p>Title: Intersection of Random Variables (Q2)</p>
<article class="question">
<p>I was told by the OH TA that to determine independence of two random variables, a good approach is to find a counterexample. I know that P(X=x and Y=y) = P(X=x)P(Y=y) if independent, and I know how to find P(X=x), but I&#39;m really stuck on finding P(X=x and Y=y). If the two dresses are from the same store, in my mind that would be like tossing two separate coins (which should be independent). Do you have any tips to get me started on finding the intersection here? </p>

uh I guess so, try approaching it similarly to how you approached the other probabilities

<article class="question">
<p>What do you mean the other probabilities? I know how to find P(X=x) and P(Y=y). But I don&#39;t have anything to go off of for P(X=x and Y=y)? The only thing I can think of doing for finding P(X=x and Y=y) is to multiply P(X=x)P(Y=y), but that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to determine. What&#39;s a better way of determining whether the independence condition holds? Since they&#39;re two different hoods, I don&#39;t see how they are correlated, so it intuitively makes sense to just do P(X=x)P(Y=y) but then we&#39;re just using the targeted result to prove the targeted result.</p>

<p></p>
<p>for example if I drew an eulerian graph w/6 edges, the max degree is 2 but can be 2-colorable</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>The claim is saying that if the max degree in a graph is $$k$$, then the graph <strong>can be </strong>colored using $$k+1$$ colors. This is not to say that this is the minimum number of colors needed to color the graph. </p>
</article>
<p>Response Time: 0:01:55</p>
<article class="question">
<p>Thank you! Also to follow up, is the converse of this proof true?</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>Not quite. For example, let $$k = 3$$ and consider a graph with two vertices with a single edge between them. Then indeed, the graph can be colored using $$3 + 1 = 4$$ colors, but the max degree in the graph is not $$3$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>You then might be tempted to say something along the lines of &#34;If a graph can be colored using $$k+1$$ colors, then the max degree in the graph is <strong>at most </strong>k&#34;. But even that statement is false.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, consider a star graph with one central vertex $u$, and a set of vertices $$B$$ such that $$|B| = 2k$$, and there are $$2k$$ edges in the graph of the form $$(b_i, u)$$. So basically, one edge for each vertex in $$B$$ which connects that vertex to $$u$$. This graph can be colored using $$2$$ colors (basically color $$u$$ blue and all vertices in $$B$$ red). So that would mean that $$k = 1$$. But indeed, the max degree in the graph is not $$k = 1$$, it is $$2k$$ and $$1 < 2k$$. </p>

So can&#39;t we have a graph that has a beginner node who is only friends with an intermediate node, and the intermediate node is friends with also the advanced node, making the graph 3-colorable? And in this graph it is not necessarily true the beginner node is adjacent to both an intermediate neighbor and an advanced neighbor, even though the graph is 3-colorable.

<p>Instead of thinking of $$\frac{(n-1)!}{n!}$$ being computed as the product of probabilities, it is probably better to think of it as being computed as $$\frac{|E_i|}{|\Omega|}$$. The sample space is all ways that the $$n$$ people can get their hats back which means $$|\Omega| = n!$$. The event $$E_i$$ is the event that the $$i$$th person gets their hat back.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So you can think of $$|E_i|$$ as computing the amount of permutations of $$\{1, ..., n\}$$ where $$i$$ is in the $$i$$th spot. This can be done in $$(n-1)!$$ ways.</p>

<p>I think proof by construction is sometimes alright when proving existence of a graph. For example, if we were asked to prove that &#34;there exists a tree with exactly two leaves&#34;, I could provide a method of construction.</p>

<p>However, in general, proofs by construction aren&#39;t too great and can be finicky at times because we need to be considerate of generalization for all graphs within our procedure (i.e. not making any logical leaps that would not work for all graphs)</p>

<p>The previous example that they reference is &#34;Prove that the sum of degrees of all nodes in a graph is twice the number of edges. Solution: Since each edge is incident to exactly two vertices, each edge contributes two to the sum of degrees of the vertices. The claim follows.&#34;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I don&#39;t really understand the reasoning for that line of the proof; how do we know that the LHS side is even? Do we know the number of edges in the graph? Thank you for the clarification!</p>

<article class="answer">
<p>The left hand side is taking the sum of the degrees of all vertices of the graph. From the handshaking lemma, we know that $$\sum_{v \in V} deg(v) = 2|E|$$, and the proof for this is given in the example referenced.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We don&#39;t know the number of edges, but since the sum of the degrees is <strong>2 times</strong> the number of edges, we can conclude that the sum of degrees must always be even.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t explicitly discuss directed graphs in the fall, but vertices have an indegree (number of edges coming in) and an outdegree (number of edges leaving). The only path in the graph would be $$u \rightarrow v$$ as you described. </p>
<p></p>
<p>For the chessmaster problem, we can rephrase it in directed graph terms: consider a graph $$G$$ on $$n$$ vertices, such that between every pair of vertices $$x, y$$ there exists edge either $$(x, y)$$ or $$(y, x)$$. Show that there exists some vertex $$v$$ such that the shortest path distance from this vertex to every other vertex is at most 2. </p>

<article class="question">
<md>
Hmm even I did induction on the HW, but I was thinking about something slightly different. Would this proof by contradiction work?

Let the graph be $$G(V,E)$$, we want to prove that $$\exists g\in V s.t, \forall v\in V\setminus\{g\}, (g,v)\in E\lor ((g,u)\in E\land(u,v)\in E)$$. Assume for contradiction that $$\forall g\in V, \exists v\in V\setminus\{g\}, s.t, (g,v)\notin E\land \lnot ((g,u)\in E\land(u,v)\in E)$$.

The assumption means that for all vertices in $$V$$, there exists a vertex that it has neither directly beaten nor indirectly beaten. Let $$g\in V$$ be arbitrary but particular. Let $$F_g$$ be the set of all vertices $$g$$ has beaten directly ($$x\in F_g\iff (g,x)\in E$$). 

By the assumption, there is a vertex $$a\notin F_g$$. Since all vertices have edges going between them, $$(g,a)\notin E\implies (a,g)\in E\implies g\in F_a$$, where $$F\_a$$ is the set of all vertices $$a$$ beat directly ($$x\in F_a\iff (a,x)\in E$$). Moreover, by the assumption, no vertex that is in $$F_g$$ has beaten $$a$$ (because if $$x\in F_g\land (x,a)\in E$$, we would have that $$(g,x)\in E\land(x,a)\in E$$, which violates the assumption). If no vertex in $$F_g$$ has beaten $$a$$, that means $$a$$ has beaten all of them, so $$F_g\subset F_a$$. It is a proper subset as $$g\in F_a$$, and $$g\notin F_g$$ (clearly). Hence, we have that $$|F_a|>|F_g|$$.

By the assumption, there is a vertex $$b\notin F\_a$$, so we can repeat this exact same process again and obtain $$|F_b|>|F_a|$$ 

Since the assumption applies to all vertices, we can simply repeat this process again and again, and we would eventually go through all the vertices (if we cannot repeat this process for any one vertex, it would violate the assumption), and we would obtain that $$|F_g|<|F_a|<|F_b|<|F_c|...<|F_y|<...<|F_n|$$ (this inequality contains the $$'F'$$ sets for all vertices in $$V$$). This means that $$n$$ is the vertex that has beaten the most people directly, but by the assumption, there is a vertex $$y\notin F_n$$ that it has not beaten directly or indirectly, which means that we can repeat the above process with $$y$$, and get the inequality $$|F_n|<|F_y|$$. 
This is a contradiction, as we now have that $$|F_y|<|F_n|<|F_y|$$, which means $$|F_y|<|F_y|$$.  Hence, the assumption is wrong, and the claim is proven.

Would this be shorter or longer than induction? Also, if it doesn't work, then what changes would have to be made? </md>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>I think this solution is basically same as the alternate solution provided below. The &#34;repeat the process again and again&#34; to obtain $$|F_g|<|F_a|<|F_b|<...<|F_n|$$ isn&#39;t my favorite, so I think it would be easier to say, &#34;Let $$g$$ be the vertex with the greatest outdegree,&#34; and continue with the first few paragraphs of your proof (excluding the last one, basically). This is basically what the alternate solution below does, and you know that there is a vertex with maximum outdegree because there are a finite number of vertices.</p>

<article class="question">
<p>In general, should we be using induction on the edges in a graph rather than the vertices, and if so why?</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>What you induct on really depends on the problem. Also, both induction on edges and induction on vertices have their own separate issues, so it just depends.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, inducting on vertices can sometimes be annoying because when you remove a vertex, you also have to remove all incident edges. But at the same time, inducting on vertices can be nice when you can guarantee existence of a specific type of vertex in a graph (i.e a leaf in a tree)</p>
<p></p>
<p>What&#39;s nice about edge induction is that when you remove an edge, you don&#39;t <em>have</em> to remove any vertices, but removing edges can disconnect the graph, and removing edges in general may not be as easy to generalize as removing vertices.</p>

<p>Why are these solutions true?</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>For c, $$Pr[B] = \frac{|B|}{|\Omega|} = \frac{|\Omega|}{|\Omega|} = 1$$. To deem if $$A$$ and $$B$$ are independent, we need to check if $$Pr[A] \cdot Pr[B] = Pr[A \cap B]$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We have $$Pr[A] = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega} = \frac{3}{5}$$. And we have that $$A \cap B = \{a, b, c\}$$ so $$Pr[A \cap B] = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|\Omega|} = \frac{3}{5}$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>So since $$Pr[A] \cdot Pr[B] = \frac35 \cdot 1 = \frac35 = Pr[A \cap B]$$, we have that $$A$$ and $$B$$ are independent.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For part d, &#34;pairwise independence&#34; means for any <strong>two </strong>events, they must be independent. You can verify independence in the same way as we did above. &#34;mutual independence&#34; means that for any <strong>subset</strong> of the events, the probability of their intersection must equal the product of the individual probabilities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can see that $$Pr[A] = Pr[B] = Pr[C] = \frac12$$. And we have that $$A \cap B \cap C = \{b\}$$, Thus, since $$Pr[A \cap B \cap C] \neq Pr[A] \cdot Pr[B] \cdot Pr[C]$$, we can conclude that A, B, and C are not mutually independent.</p>

<p>ehh it&#39;s not really exactly handshaking lemma -- it&#39;s more of a corollary of it. But for the purpose of the exam, you can just say &#34;from the handshaking lemma, we know that there are an even number of odd degree vertices.&#34; </p>

<article class="question">
<p>How do we know that an m-augmenting path is of odd length? </p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>An m-augmenting path must be of odd length. This is because an m-augmenting path <strong>is</strong> an m-alternating path. So if you consider an m-augmenting path that traverses the vertices in the following order: $$v_0, v_1, v_2, ..., v_{2k+1}$$, we have by definition that $$v_0$$ and $$v_{2k+1}$$ are unsaturated, which means that $$\{v_0, v_1\}$$ is not in the matching, but $$\{v_1, v_2\}$$ must be. And $$\{v_2, v_3\}$$ is not in the matching, but $$\{v_3, v_4\}$$ is. Note that in order for the endpoint of the path to be unsaturated, we need $$\{v_i, v_{i+1}\}$$ to not be in the matching (where $$v_{i+1}$$ is the endpoint), which means that (by our pattern), $$i+1$$ is odd. So that&#39;s why our vertices ended with $$v_{2k+1}$$, suggesting that our path is of odd length. </p>

<p>Would a counterexample suffice for 4d? My logic is that $$R \cap S$$ is the intersection of two equivalence relations on &#34;a set $$A$$,&#34; which I take to mean we must prove the claim for <em>any</em> set $$A$$. If we believe this claim to be false, I think a counterexample should suffice, because then the claim would not be true $$\forall A$$. Would you be able to confirm this for me? Thank you!</p>

<p>Title: Q4: What does &#34;any one type of milk&#34; mean?</p>
<article class="question">
<p>In the problem statement, we are given that &#34;for any given variety of cereal, the number of different types of milk that it tastes good with is always greater than or equal to the number of varieties of cereal that any one type of milk tastes good with&#34;.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Parsing the question, it seems to me that this means that every cereal goes well with at least $$x$$ types of milk. I&#39;m confused about what the problem says that $$x$$ is.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Is it the maximum number of varieties of cereal that go well with any type of milk? Or is it the maximum number of varieties of cereal that go well with the types of milk that go well with our given variety of cereal? Something else?</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>If a cereal goes well with $$x$$ types of milk, then for <strong>every </strong>milk, it must go well with <strong>no more than </strong>$$x$$ types of cereal. So in a sense, $$x$$ is the &#34;minimum&#34; number of milks a cereal can go well with. But at the same time, we do not know the exact value of $$x$$.</p>

<article class="question">
<p>A Hamiltonian cycle in a graph $$G$$ is a cycle in which each vertex of $$G$$ appears exactly once. A graph is Hamiltonian if it contains a Hamiltonian cycle.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Does the fact that it is a cycle not mean that one vertex will be present twice at the beginning and ending?</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>Yeah, a hamiltonian cycle <strong>is </strong>a cycle, so it will start and end at the same vertex</p>
</article>
<p>Response Time: 1:03:46</p>
<article class="question">
<p>Ya I got that but the definition has &#34;each vertex of $$G$$ appears exactly once&#34; but in a cycle the start and end vertex is same so it appears twice right which conrtadicts the definitions part saying &#34;exactly once&#34;</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>yeah it&#39;s one of those things where we don&#39;t feel like specifying &#34;each vertex of $$G$$ appears exactly once except for the vertex that you start and end at&#34; because it&#39;s just unnecessary extra wording. We sort of incorporate that into the definition implicitly by noting that we are talking about cycles. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Tangentially, if we are being super careful, we can note that the definition of a hamiltonian cycle mentions that it is a <em>cycle</em>. And the definition of a cycle is a <em>closed path. </em>And a closed path is a <em>path</em> in which the start vertex and end vertex are the same. So I suppose the &#34;issue&#34; stems from the definition of path or closed path. But again, we sort of take this stuff for granted with these definitions and implicitly include these &#34;edge conditions&#34; when defining other terms.</p>

<p><em>Thus, there must be n|A| edges from A to NG(A). We also know that each column in NG(A) has at most n edges back to A, meaning that there are at most n|NG(A)| edges from NG(A) to A. <strong>This means that n|A| ≤ n|NG(A)|</strong>.</em></p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>We&#39;re basically counting the number of edges that &#34;leave&#34; $$A$$ and enter $$N_G(A)$$. We first conclude that there must be $$n|A|$$ edges from $$A$$ to $$N_G(A)$$, but that can be upper bounded by the second sentence by shifting our focus to $$N_G(A)$$ and seeing that there are at most $$n|N_G(A)|$$ edges from $$N_G(A)$$ to $$A$$. Note that there must be the same amount of edges going from $$A$$ to $$N_G(A)$$ as there are going from $$N_G(A)$$ to $$A$$ (in fact, they are the same edges). Since we have <strong>at most</strong> that many edges, we have an upper bound, so composing the two results together, we get $$n|A| \leq n|N_G(A)|$$</p>

</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>You can assume that you can always fit $$k$$ pawns on each row. That is, it is not necessarily true that each pawn will occupy one square. So there could be many pawns on a single square, but they will always all fit on the row.</p>

<p>Title: Ramsey Number Clarification</p>
<article class="question">
<p>I&#39;m a bit confused about the definition of a Ramsey number; how can a complete graph be 2-colored? If every vertex has an edge from every other vertex, for say the example of R(3,3)&lt;=6, I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s possible for that graph to be 2-colored.</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>Here, the term &#34;coloring&#34; just means that we are assigning colors to the edges without the constraint of edges incident to the same vertex having different colors. So the Ramsey number is saying if $$R(k, l) = n$$, then for <strong>any</strong> assignment of colors (either red or blue) to the edges of the complete graph on $$n$$ vertices, you can find a red clique of size $$k$$ or a blue clique of size $$l$$.</p>

<p>Title: lecture 10h notes question</p>
<article class="question">
<p>Hello, </p>
<p>I&#39;m looking over lecture notes to prepare for the final and I have a question about one of the examples. In lecture 10h, there is an example problem calculating the variance of the hat problem we did in lecture 9h. When we are calculating the variance, the problem calculates $$E[X^{2}]$$ as follows:</p>
<p>$$E[X^{2}]= \sum_{i=1}^{n} E[X_{i}^{2}] + 2 \sum_{i<j}E[X_iX_j]$$</p>
<p>Where $$X_{i}$$ is if the ith person gets their hat back. I&#39;m wondering why we split the one variable i into 2, i and j. Where does the second summation term come from? Thank you </p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>We defined indicators in such a way that $$X = X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n$$. So $$\mathbb{E}[X^2] = \mathbb{E}[(X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n)^2] = \mathbb{E}[(X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n)(X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n)] $$</p>
<p></p>
<p>Multiply the two expressions to get: </p>
<p>$$\mathbb{E}[X_1X_1 + X_1X_2 + ... + X_1X_n + X_2X_1 + X_2X_2 + .... + X_2X_n + ... + X_nX_1 + X_nX_2 + ... + X_nX_n]$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>We&#39;ll &#34;group together&#34; terms of the form $$X_iX_i$$, so we have:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\mathbb{E}[X_1X_1 + X_2X_2 + ... + X_nX_n + X_1X_2 + X_1X_3 + ... + X_nX_{n-1}]$$ (just rearranging the terms in a friendly way here).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Use LOE: </p>
<p>$$\mathbb{E}[X_1X_1] + \mathbb{E}[X_2X_2] + ... + \mathbb{E}[X_nX_n] + \mathbb{E}[X_1X_2] + \mathbb{E}[X_1X_3] + ... + \mathbb{E}[X_nX_{n-1}]$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first $$n$$ terms can be grouped into one summation, and the last terms will have their own summation:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{E}[X_iX_i] + \sum_{i \neq j, 1 \leq i, j \leq n} \mathbb{E}[X_iX_j]$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, we can just rewrite some terms to match the expression:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{E}[X_i^2] + 2 \sum_{i < j} \mathbb{E}[X_iX_j]$$. Note that the bounds of $$i$$ and $$j$$ are held implicitly in the second summation.</p>

<p>In the TR b, it says G has max degree of delta. Then chromatic number of G = delta &#43; 1</p>
<p>How is this different from the lecture lemma &#34;graph with maximum degree at most k is k&#43;1 colorable&#34;?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here delta = k: max degree delta is within the bounds of &#34;at most k&#34;, so wouldn&#39;t that make the graph delta&#43;1 colorable? Thank you!</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>The chromatic number refers to the <strong>minimum </strong>number of colors needed to color the graph. So while a graph with maximum degree $$\Delta$$ is $$\Delta + 1$$ colorable, there are some graphs with max degree $$\Delta$$ that can be colored in less than $$\Delta + 1$$ colors.</p>

<p>Title: Proof by contradiction that in any planar graph the minimum degree is at most 5</p>
<article class="question">
<p>In class today, we proved that in any planar graph with $$n$$ vertices $$\delta(G) \leq 5$$ by assuming for contradiction. In class, we assumed that $$\delta(G) \geq 6$$, after which the proof follows as such:</p>
<p></p>
<p>          $$\sum_{v \in V}deg(v) \geq 6n$$, and so by handshake lemma $$2|E| = \sum_{v \in V}deg(v) \geq 6n$$. or that $$|E| \geq 3n$$.</p>
<p>          Using the corollary proved in class that in a planar graph with at least 2 edges, $$|E| \leq 3|V| - 6$$, we have that $$3n \leq 3n - 6$$, or that $$0 \leq -6$$, a clear contradiction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, if you assume for contradiction that $$\delta(G) > 5$$, we have the following:</p>
<p></p>
<p>          $$\sum_{v \in V}deg(v) > 5n$$, and so by handshake lemma $$2|E| = \sum_{v \in V}deg(v) > 5n$$. or that $$|E| > \frac{5n}{2}$$.</p>
<p>          Using the corollary proved in class that in a planar graph with at least 2 edges, $$|E| \leq 3|V| - 6$$, we have that $$\frac{5n}{2} < 3n - 6$$, or that $$n > 12$$. This doesn&#39;t seem to be a contradiction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Clearly, the proof doesn&#39;t follow when assuming $$\delta(G) > 5$$, so why does it work when assuming $$\delta(G) \leq 6$$ rather than $$\delta(G) > 5$$? </p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>It&#39;s mainly due to the strictness of the bound. While saying that $$\sum_{v \in V} deg(v) > 5n$$ is not false, the value of $$5n$$ is a weak lower bound. We can see this because (for non-trivial values of $$n$$) we would also be able to say $$\sum_{v \in V} deg(v) > 5n+1$$ or $$\sum_{v \in V} deg(v) > 5n + 2$$ and so on. And those claims would indeed be true. Since &#34;degree&#34; takes on an integer value, when considering the sum, it is best to lower bound by the absolute minimum value of the degree (that a vertex can have), which in this case is $$6$$. Then, we have a much stricter lower bound, which helps with the calculations</p>

<p></p>
<p>(sum X_i) ^2 = sum (X_i)^2 &#43; sum_i sum_j X_i X_j</p>

<p>is this correct?</p>
<p>Also, how do we find the amount of sums in the second part of the equation?</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>$$(\sum_{i=1}^n X_i)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 + \sum_{1 \leq i, j \leq n, i \neq j} X_i X_j$$</p>

<p>Or equivalently, $$\sum_{i = 1}^n X_i^2 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} X_iX_j$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>To calculate the number of terms in the second summation, let&#39;s view the first equation I provided. There are $$n$$ options for $$i$$. There are $$n-1$$ options for $$j$$ because we must have $$i \neq j$$. So the second summation has $$n \cdot (n-1)$$ terms.</p>

<article class="answer">
<p>$$X_i$$ is an indicator that is $$1$$ when the $$i$$th bin is empty. In other words, for each of the $$n$$ balls, we want them to land in a bin other than bin $$n$$. Thus, for a given ball, there are $$n-1$$ &#34;good&#34; bins that it can fall into (we subtract 1 to <strong>remove</strong> bin i). There are $$n$$ total bins. So the probability that a single ball does not fall into bin $$i$$ is $$\frac{n-1}{n}$$. Use independence to see that the probability that <strong>all $$n$$ </strong>balls do not fall into bin $$i$$ is $$(\frac{n-1}{n})^n)$$. Thus, $$Pr[X_i = 1] = (\frac{n-1}{n})^n$$</p>

I&#39;m not sure how to reconcile this with the fact that the when the first person selects, they could have taken any number of music drives with their p, meaning there could be less than c options for Selena?

<p>yeah the way around this would be to case based on the number of drives with music remaining, but this is quite challenging and time consuming to do, which is why we &#34;reverse&#34; the procedure.

<p>Title: Random question about planar graphs and 3D objects</p>
<article class="question">
<p>Can every 3D object that doesn&#39;t have any holes in it (nothing topologically equivalent to a donut or other things) be converted into a planar graph and likewise, can every planar graph be converted into a 3D representation. Every corner where at least 3 edges meet can be a vertex. I have tried a few examples and it seems to hold so far. Every tree would just be a sphere like object. The version of the handshake lemma where you sum up the degree of the faces also works for the objects. The reason why I specified that the object should have no holes is because there ends up being extra faces in the planar graph. The space inside the hole, which should be counted as the out side graph face, becomes an inner face, so the lemma doesn&#39;t work. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I did try drawing the 3D equivalent of a k3,3 graph to see if it would break anything and I got this weird Mobius strip thing with twists that couldn&#39;t really be turned into an enclosed 3D object (I could have just drawn it wrong). I haven&#39;t tried doing it with a k5 graph, but I am assuming something similar will happen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anyone know anything about this or how one could prove something like this. </p>
<p>(sorry if this was poorly explained)</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>I think I&#39;ve heard something about planar graphs being related to a sphere in 3D space by triangulation. Haven&#39;t read up on this recently, but it might be something worthwhile to check out. I think I&#39;m just a little bit confused as to how you are translating the planar graph to 3D space. Can you go into the process of making the tree a &#34;sphere-like object&#34;.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are many other TAs that have better expertise in this subject than myself, so they may be able to chime in. If explaining it via text proves to be too difficult, I am holding office hours on Monday evening and would love for you to come by and explain this to me. </p>

<p>The spherical shape is the only way to have the faces of the planar graph and the 3D object work. Since in a tree, there is only one face, it would translate to a object that only has 1 face. The edges of the tree would be sort of like a ridge, but since there is no cycle, this ridge doesn&#39;t fully wrap around the sphere. making two distinct faces. </p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>Ah I see. I&#39;ve thought about this quite a bit and am leaning towards the idea that every flat-faced 3D shape that is topologically equivalent to a sphere can be represented as a planar graph. And the idea is basically to cast it as a net in 2-space. I think there is probably some logical extension to make this hold true for non-flat-faced 3D solids, but I think there are some edge cases to handle and/or specify how to handle them. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The converse, however, seems to be much more difficult for me to conceptualize. I mostly think this because there is quite a bit of freedom in how you can transpose a 2-space figure into 3-space (admittedly, there is also quite a bit of freedom when reducing 3-space to 2-space, but I think in general, this transformation is a bit more constrained). I&#39;ll think about this some more though. Thank you for bringing up this question because it has been really fun to think about!</p>

<p>Could I get some help on how this work was derived, especially the first two lines?</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>The first line is using the law of total expectation. For the second line, we have that $$Pr[Y = 1] = p$$ because that is the probability of success on the first trial. In the case that the first trial was successful, we stop with the procedure, and we have $$X = 1$$. So that would mean $$E[X] = 1$$ and $$E[X^2] = 1$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>If the first trial was unsuccessful, then we have $$Y = 0$$, and this occurs with probability $$(1-p)$$. Then we &#34;ignore&#34; this trial, and consider the expected number of trials to get a success, but we add one for the failed trial that we just had, so we have $$E[X^2 | Y = 0] = E[(X+1)^2]$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Substitution of the above quantities gives the second line.</p>

<p>We have $$E[ X^2 \mid  Y=0] = E[X\cdot X \mid Y=0]$$. By the memoryless property, $$E[X\mid Y=0] = E[X+1]$$, so $$E[X\cdot X \mid Y=0] = E[(X+1)(X+1)]$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>More intuitively, we want to &#34;add 1&#34; to the number of trials we have to perform, and the thing we are squaring is the &#34;number of trials&#34;.</p>

<article class="question">
<p>How is Pr[n=k] always 1/11? Because there is no replacement, isn&#39;t Pr[n=1] = 1/11, Pr[n=2] = 2/10, Pr[n=3] = 3/9, etc.? </p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>$$Pr[n=2]$$ can be calculating the probability that you do not get the candy bar you like on the first trial multiplied with the probability that you get it on the second trial. </p>
<p></p>
<p>There is a $$\frac{10}{11}$$ chance of not getting the candy bar you like on the first trial. After this, the candy bar you have received has run out in the vending machine, so there are only 10 candy bars left, one of which is your favorite. So the probability that you get your favorite candy bar on the second trial is $$\frac{1}{10}$$. So we have $$Pr[n=2] = \frac{10}{11} \cdot \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{11}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can use this same process for all values of $$k$$, and see that it is always true that $$Pr[n = k] = \frac{1}{11}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another way of arguing the probability is by considering the sample space being permutations of the candy bars. The event of interest is that the candy bar you like is in the $$k$$th position. The cardinality of the sample space is $$11!$$. The cardinality of the event set is $$1 \cdot (11-1)! = 10!$$. So the probability of the event is $$\frac{10!}{11!} = \frac{1}{11}$$</p>

<p>Title: Irrationality Proof</p>
<article class="question">
<p>Hi,</p>
<p></p>
<p>How would we go about the proof that root 40 is irrational using the argument p|ab implies p|a or p|b.</p>
</article>
<article class="answer">
Yeah I think following the proof format of how we proved $$\sqrt{2}$$ is irrational for this problem would be kind of tough (mostly because the multiplicity of 2 in 40’s prime factorization is not 1). The way I would go about proving this is noting that $$\sqrt{40 = 2\sqrt{10}$$ and then showing that $$\sqrt{10} is irrational (which is easier to do). Finally you can conclude that an irrational multiplied with a non-zero rational is irrational.

How did we get from the second to third line?</md>
</article>
<article class="answer">
<p>$$E[X_i]$$ was previously calculated to be $$\frac12$$, so the second term of $$E[X_i]^2 = (\frac12)^2$$. For the first term, we note that $$X_i$$ takes on the values of $$0, 1$$ or $$2$$. This means that $$X_i^2$$ takes on one of the values from the set $$\{0^2, 1^2, 2^2\} = \{0, 1, 4\}$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>We have $$E[X_i^2] = \sum_k k \cdot Pr[X_i^2 = k] = 0 \cdot Pr[X_i^2 = 0] + 1 \cdot Pr[X_i^2 = 1] + 4 \cdot Pr[X_i^2 = 4] = Pr[X_i^2 = 1] + 4 \cdot Pr[X_i^2 = 4]$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For $$X_i^2 = 1$$, we need $$X_i = 1$$, and that occurs with probability $$\frac16$$. Similarly, for $$X_i^2 = 4$$, we need $$X_i = 2$$ and that occurs with probability $$\frac16$$. Plug back in, and you&#39;re good to go.</p>

Removing an endpoint ensures that we have an independent set. You can find that p=1/d maximizes the quantity by taking the partial derivative with respect to p, and set that result equal to 0 and solve for p. We will not expect you to do something like this on the final.

Piazza is a Q&A platform designed to get you great answers from classmates and instructors fast. We've put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started:

<ol style="margin:0;padding:0;list-style-position:inside;"> <li style="margin:0;padding:0"><strong>Ask questions!</strong>

The best way to get answers is to ask questions! Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are).

</li><li style="margin:0;padding:0"><strong>Edit questions and answers wiki-style.</strong>

Think of Piazza as a Q&A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single <strong>students' answer</strong> that students can edit collectively (and a single <strong>instructors’ answer</strong> for instructors).

</li><li style="margin:0;padding:0"> <strong>Add a followup to comment or ask further questions.</strong>

To comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a <strong>followup discussion</strong>. Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&A above.

</li><li style="margin:0;padding:0"> <strong>Go anonymous.</strong>

Shy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously.

</li><li style="margin:0;padding:0"> <strong>Tag your posts.</strong>

It's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a “#” before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag.

</li><li style="margin:0;padding:0"> <strong>Format code and equations.</strong>

Adding a code snippet? Click the <strong>pre</strong> or <strong>tt</strong> button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text. 
Mathematical equation? Click the <strong>Fx</strong> button to access the LaTeX editor to build a nicely formatted equation.

</li><li style="margin:0;padding:0"> <strong>View and download class details and resources.</strong> </li></ol>

Click the <strong>Course Page</strong> button in your top bar to access the class syllabus, staff contact information, office hours details, and course resources—all in one place!

We recommend using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.overleaf.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Overleaf</a>. One of our TAs Ishaan has recorded <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmQuOprb7Pc" rel="noopener noreferrer">a quick tutorial that should get you up to speed for working on homework 1T</a>, and we will do another overview in recitation this week. <b><i>For homework 1T only</i></b>, if you do not yet feel comfortable using LaTeX you may submit the homework problems as a <i>legible</i> PDF created however you feel most comfortable.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">The first office hours are today from 4 PM to 10 PM. For a full list of office hours times and the location, see our website at <a target="_blank" href="http://cis1600.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">cis1600.com</a>. See @6 for more infomation regarding Office Hours. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also released today is a short <i>graded</i> quiz on our course policies. The policies are all available at <a target="_blank" href="http://cis1600.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">cis1600.com</a>, and the quiz just lets us know that you have read the course policies and understand what is and isn’t allowed when forming study groups with other students. This quiz is also due Wednesday at 11:59 pm, but if you are reading this after joining the course late, we have enabled late submissions with no penalty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Finally, we hope that everyone will have a great semester, and we look forward to interacting with all of you in person :)<br /><br /></p>
<p>In the 3rd problem do you want us to justify our answer via mathematical proofs or via words and explanation?</p>
Either is fine!
<p>can we submit multiple times on gradescope until the deadline?</p>
<p>yep</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Q2:</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Q3:</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In problem 1, is there a difference between the statements &#34;The students want to make delicious pasta,&#34; and &#34;the students all want to make delicious pasta&#34; (from part b)?</p>
No. No difference.
<p>I want to confirm in question 2 part b that the first part of the proposition is supposed to say if p and not p.</p>
Yes. It is correct as written.
<p>Hi, I wonder how should I fill in my recitation number in the homework. Thanks.</p>
<p>In the template, you will see</p>
<pre>
\newcommand{\MyRecitation}{X}</pre>
<p>You should replace the X with your recitation number. For example, it could look something like this:</p>
<p></p>
<pre>
\newcommand{\MyRecitation}{202}</pre>
<p>For question one, do we have to distribute any expressions in parentheses or just leave them as is?</p>
<p>Either is fine.</p>
<p>How do we save our LaTeX file so that we can edit later (or does it autosave)?</p>
<p>The LaTeX file will auto-save on Overleaf.</p>
<p>For question 2a how am I supposed to state my final solution. In LaTeX when I create another &#34;\item&#34; after the first table, my answer has a &#34;(b)&#34; in front of it, and it offsets the next part of the question to (c) instead of (b)</p>
<p>You can write below the truth table and before part (b). So you can write in the space after the </p>
<pre>
\end{tabular}</pre>
<p>and before the</p>
<pre>
\item</pre>
<p>For Q3, do all the TAs have a single piece of pasta from the 5 total pieces?</p>
<p>Each of the TAs has exactly one piece of pasta. But each of those pieces of pasta come from the 5 total pieces.</p>
<p>Which symbol should we use for not: ˜ or ¬ ?</p>
<p>Either is fine, but in this class, we typically use $$\lnot$$</p>
<p>For necessary conditions should we write it as</p>
<p></p>
<p>¬p → ¬q or q → p</p>
<p></p>
<p>Or are both forms okay?</p>
<p>Any logically correct solution will receive credit.</p>
<p>Can you please provide an example annotation of &#34;if A or B then not C&#34;</p>
<p>Please see the LaTeX Demo video linked in @7. At around the ~11:47 mark, we cover some of the LaTeX commands for logical operators.</p>
<p>Can you please provide an example annotation of &#34;if A or B then not C&#34;</p>
<p>I understand how to make symbols. I am more confused on the math side of how to construct the equations. </p>
<p>Can you please provide an example annotation of &#34;if A or B then not C&#34;</p>
<p>This may be a good question for office hours. We have office hours going on now, and will continue running until 10PM today.</p>
<p>Can you please provide an example annotation of &#34;if A or B then not C&#34;</p>
<p>Where is office hours at?</p>
<p>Can you please provide an example annotation of &#34;if A or B then not C&#34;</p>
<p>ohq.io</p>
<p>Should 1f be written as one logical statement or split into two?</p>
<p>This is your decision. Any logically correct solution will receive credit.</p>
<p>Where and when is office hours today?</p>
<p>Is it in Greenberg Loungs Skirkanich 114 right now?</p>
<p>Where and when is office hours today?</p>
<p>No. Office hours are being held virtually on OHQ now until 8PM. Then they will be in Greenberg starting at 8PM until 10PM.</p>
<p>Is there any logical difference between not and negation (\bar vs \lnot)?</p>
<p>No. They are the same.</p>
<p>Are we permitted to use the internet to look up a LaTeX command? </p>
<p>please refer to the resources listed here for help with LaTeX: <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1600/current/resources.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1600/current/resources.html</a></p>

<p>Just wondering what does this mean: &#34;5 points will be deducted from your homework if you do not select pages when submitting to Gradescope.&#34; Thanks!</p>
<p>When you submit your homework to gradescope, you will be prompted to assign pages (of your pdf) to each of the questions. Failure to do so would result in that 5 point deduction.</p>
<p>Just wondering what does this mean: &#34;5 points will be deducted from your homework if you do not select pages when submitting to Gradescope.&#34; Thanks!</p>
<p>I just submitted my homework, but there was no page for me to label which page contains which question. Also, after my submission, gradescope said that there was an error.</p>

<p>Oh nevermind. So sorry that I just submitted my homework to the wrong course. </p>
<p>For Q3, can the TAs see which of the 5 total pieces remain after the 3 pieces have been distributed?</p>
<p>no</p>

<p>Hello! The words in my Latex cram together like the above. Is there any way that I can fix this problem?</p>
<p>you probably have not exited math mode. Remember that math mode needs a starting dollar sign and a closing dollar sign.</p>

<p>Typing inside $ $ enters math mode and formats it that way. Just type outside the $ $.</p>
<p>Should Question 3 on the homework be answered in paragraph/written explanations or using logical operators? Alternatively, are written explanations sufficient to answer the question?</p>
<p>@7_f2</p>
<p>Are office hours also held online today (are they always online)? Also what time are office hours today?</p>
<p>Office hours will be held <strong>in-person </strong>today from 4-10PM. So you will want to be in Greenberg lounge to get help. You will still need to log in to OHQ to enter the queue.</p>
<p>What is the difference between negation (\bar) and not (\lnot)?</p>
<p>@8_f15</p>
<p>For future reference, is there a way/are we allowed to edit or resubmit after we have already submitted as long as it is before the deadline? </p>
<p>Yes. You can submit on Gradescope as many times as you would like before the deadline. Gradescope will use your last submission as your final submission.</p>
<p>Where could one find the 6-digit code to join the class on Gradescope?</p>
E7VVGZ
<p>How do I add a space after an operator in Latex? It keeps joining it all together.</p>
<p>you can use one of the following:</p>

<p>Will lecture recordings be available this semester? I was interested in replaying some specific notes from this morning. </p>
<p>Hi everyone, </p>
<p></p>
<p>Some students have reported they are unable to fill in the bubbles for the HW drops policy quiz question. Please carefully read the information in the question, but don&#39;t worry about filling in the bubbles if Gradescope won&#39;t let you. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Sorry for any confusion!</p>
<p>Sorry I didn&#39;t find the assignment on my gradescope. Where can I find it?</p>

<p>Hi! </p>
<p></p>
<p>At the top of the document it says that we should show all work. Question 1 specifies no work is needed. However, for question 2 I wasn&#39;t too sure how to show work as its a table with values within the table. Therefore, I was slightly confused on how to show work. Could you please provide some insight?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p dir="ltr">Hi All,</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">We have released homework 1H. It will be due at <strong>11:59pm on Monday. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">Homeworks can be found under the Homework tab on cis1600.com.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr">Finally, quick reminder that for this and all future homework assignments you are <b>REQUIRED</b> to typeset the homework using LaTeX. If you have not already watched it, I highly recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmQuOprb7Pc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our TA Ishaan’s LaTeX introduction video</a>, and we will also be discussing a little bit more about LaTeX in the first recitation.</p>
<p dir="ltr"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>The initial LaTeX template posted to the <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1600/current/homework.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> did not have a space to put your recitation number. The updated template now includes this information.</em></p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong> </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Q7: </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong> </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"></p>
<p>just a question from lecture. if the empty set is always an element of a set, then why is it not counted in the cardinality of the set? like |{1,2,3}| = 3, not 4 because you don&#39;t count the empty set....</p>
<p>The empty set is <strong>not </strong>always an element of a set. For example, $$\emptyset \notin \{1, 2, 3\}$$ but $$\emptyset \in \{1, \emptyset\}$$. Perhaps you meant to be speaking about subsets (which is a bit different than just elements)!</p>
<p>Is there recitation this week?</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>For problem 2a on the homework, are the 2 earrings in an &#34;earring pair&#34; necessarily identical?</p>
<p>Yes. The two earrings within a pair are identical.</p>
<p>In problem 1a iii) do y and z have to be different integers, or can they have the same value?</p>
<p>they can be the same!</p>
<p>In problem 1a iii) do y and z have to be different integers, or can they have the same value?</p>
<p>for the same problem, is zero in the set of positive integers?</p>
<p>In problem 1a iii) do y and z have to be different integers, or can they have the same value?</p>
No
<p>For problem 2, should the 7 grains of pasta in one earring be unique to each other or can there exist for example 2 linguine in one earing? Thanks.</p>
<p>they need not be unique. So an earring can have 2 linguini</p>
<p>for question 5, can two noodles of the same length be subtracted such that no new noodle is created (or noodle of length 0)</p>
<p>but can you use a noodle that has been created afterward?</p>
<p>for question 5, can two noodles of the same length be subtracted such that no new noodle is created (or noodle of length 0)</p>
<p>Yes, two noodles of the same length can be subtracted. In this case, we would remove those noodles and replace them with one noodle of length 0.</p>
<p>for question 5, can two noodles of the same length be subtracted such that no new noodle is created (or noodle of length 0)</p>
<p>i just want to clarify exactly what the question is asking. Is it asking whether Saurabh-violi can be sure that the final noodle will always be length 1 regardless of how the noodles are picked and subtracted?</p>
<p>for question 5, can two noodles of the same length be subtracted such that no new noodle is created (or noodle of length 0)</p>
<p>Does a noodle of length 0 still count as a noodle?</p>
<p>Can we leave our answers as a number to an exponent (say $$2^{17}$$), or do we need to calculate the exact numerical solution?</p>
<p>no need to reduce your answers to the exact value. So something like $$2^{17}$$ would be fine.</p>
<p>Can 1) iv) have multiple correct answers?</p>
<p>No. 1a) iv) has only one correct answer.</p>
<p>Are office hours in-person today?</p>
<p>OH will be held on zoom today.</p>
<p>For question 1(a), should we list the elements of the sets using set notation? </p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>Is zero considered a positive integer?</p>
<p>no.</p>
<p>Just to clarify, for question 2, the same type of pasta can be used multiple times to make an earring, right? For example, you can do penne-penne-penne. </p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>Is question 5 asking if Saurabh will always end up with a single noodle of length 1, or asking if it is possible for Saurabh to end up with a noodle of length 1?</p>
<p>It is asking if it is possible for Saurabh to end up with a noodle of length 1</p>
<p>In question 2(a), for each pair of earrings, do both earrings have to be the same or can they be different from each other?</p>
<p>both earrings are the same within a pair.</p>
In question 4, does it mean that the colors can repeat for the vertical stripes but not the horizontal ones?
<p>Colors are allowed to repeat. As shown in the diagram, there are two black horizontal stripes (hence, in this case, the color black is repeated), and there are two red vertical stripes.</p>
<p>how do i type curly braces in overleaf</p>
<pre>
\{ stuff inside curly braces \}</pre>
For Q2, does F-P-P equal P-P-F?
<p>No. These would be considered different.</p>
<p>How can I type these i ii iii iiii in Latex?</p>
<p><img src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7ga3way2da7hz%2F76f3517ab03f9e17ff79873a2713802664f786266c7b3153f0348070ab1e1a83%2Fimage.png" alt="image.png" /></p>
<p>You get those from a &#34;nested enumeration&#34;. So something like this:</p>
<p></p>
<pre>
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 	this is a
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item 	this is i
		\item 	this is ii
		\item 	this is iii
		\item   this is iv
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}</pre>
<p>For 1a, should we interpret the &#34;members of the set&#34; as the elements in set X or should write out the set that X is equivalent to, including the braces?</p>
<p>you can include the braces.</p>
<p>In Question 2a do we have unlimited supply of all 350 types of pastas or do we have a fixed number of quantity of all types to be used to make earrings? <br />Like is it possible to create a pair of earring like all 7 grains of Penne, then another pair of earrling with 6 grains of Penne and one Fettuccine and so on, so we can use Penne as many times as we want right?</p>
Correct
<p>what exactly does question 7 mean by how she should organize testing? Are we trying to minimize the amount of time it takes to identify the fault fork.... or save the greatest number of people&#39;s fingers? </p>
<p>You need to come up with a method to ensure that you have found the faulty fork. Keep in mind that if someone uses the faulty fork, they will lose their fingers at exactly 8:59.</p>
<p>what exactly does question 7 mean by how she should organize testing? Are we trying to minimize the amount of time it takes to identify the fault fork.... or save the greatest number of people&#39;s fingers? </p>
<p>sure, but you still need to come up with a method to assure that you have found the faulty fork.</p>

yeah

<p>For 2 (b) (c) (d), is it asking us the number of unique earring pairs or simply earring pairs no matter unique or not?</p>
<p>Earrings within a pair are identical to each other. Does this help?</p>
<p></p>
<p>For 2 (b) (c) (d), is it asking us the number of unique earring pairs or simply earring pairs no matter unique or not?</p>
<p>I mean (a) asks &#34;How many UNIQUE earring pairs can the Master of Linguine create?&#34; but the other questions do not mention &#34;UNIQUE.&#34; So do we have to find out the unique pairs or simply pairs both unique and not?</p>
<p>For 2 (b) (c) (d), is it asking us the number of unique earring pairs or simply earring pairs no matter unique or not?</p>
<p>Your final answer for all questions should be the number of unique earring pairs for the given question.</p>

<p>Okay, I get it. Thank you so much!</p>
<p>For question 6. when it says that for each, the dishes next to it are a different type, does that mean if the dish is a meat dish, its neighborings have to be veggie dishes and vice versa?</p>
<md>That's true.</md>
<p>Can you use summations in set builder notation?</p>
yeah
<p>For question 5, what happens to the new noodle that Saurabh makes after selecting two random noodles? Does he use this new noodle and selects another random noodle and creates another noodle with the difference between the two?</p>
The new noodle gets added to the group of noodles. And then he chooses two noodles from the group (one of which COULD be the new noodle but doesn’t have to be)
<p>In which office are the OH today?</p>
I think they are online today
<p>For question 4 what does &#34;any two stripes that have the same color cannot share a long edge&#34; mean? I see red can be repeated on the vertical stripes and black was repeated on the bottom stripes. </p>
<p>So the same color cannot be next to each other in the bottom stripes and they cannot be next to each other in the top stripes?</p>
<p>In the answer to the first question of this post (<a href="/class/l6vqf2f5p8e6c1/post/17_f29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://piazza.com/class/l6vqf2f5p8e6c1/post/17_f29)</a>, the TA says &#34;If you wish to prove the statement wrong, though, <strong>you have to consider all “examples”</strong>&#34;. What does &#34;consider all examples&#34; exactly mean? What are the examples and exactly how many examples we will have to consider?</p>
<p>I&#39;m not exactly sure what they mean by &#34;all examples&#34;, but if I had to venture a guess, they were trying to say that in order to disprove the statement, you would have to consider all possible noodle manipulations that Saurabh can do (i.e. every sequence of choices of pairs of noodles he can make) and show that none of them result in a noodle of length 1. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Should we assume commonly used theorems as axioms or should they be stated as theorems? Are we allowed to use theorems in our proofs?</p>
If we have seen the theorem being used in class, recitation or a previous HW, then you can cite it. Else, you should be proving said theorem/axiom (not just stating it)
<p>For question 6 is there a specific dish (meat or vegetable) that Brian wants to end his arrangement on? </p>
<p>it doesn&#39;t make sense to end a circle</p>
<p>Can all of question 2 be solved using the multiplicative rule used in class, or do some require other methods used in combinatorics, like casework?</p>
<p>Just to clarify, I am generally asking about any methods not discussed in class, casework is just one specific method.</p>
<p>Can all of question 2 be solved using the multiplicative rule used in class, or do some require other methods used in combinatorics, like casework?</p>
<p>But can the problems be solved without it?</p>

All problems can be solved using material covered in lecture
<p>For set builder notation, can we use words instead of the notation? For example, {x| x is an odd integer and a multiple of 7 that is less than 100}?</p>
sure
<p>Do I have to prove the associative property for addition or can I assume it as an axiom?</p>
You can assume this
<p>In question 6 do we know the total number of dishes on the table?</p>
No. That is what you are trying to solve for.
<p>In question 6, what is the importance of there needing to be at least 1 meat dish and 1 veggie dish? Isn&#39;t it implied that a singular dish can&#39;t be a circle and that for there to be multiple meat dishes there needs to be multiple veggie dishes so the neighboring dishes are different types?</p>
The “importance” is somewhat subjective, I suppose. However, it is a critical piece of information for the problem. Think of it as a “constraint” on the set of all possible arrangements. How you choose to use this information is something we want you to think about, and something to argue in your solution/proof.

Isn&#39;t it implied that a singular dish can&#39;t be a circle and that for there to be multiple meat dishes there needs to be multiple veggie dishes so the neighboring dishes are different types?</p>
<p>Without the &#34;at least&#34; information, wouldn&#39;t the set all of arrangments still be the same? You can&#39;t have all meat or all veggie. What do you mean by contraint? </p>

Isn&#39;t it implied that a singular dish can&#39;t be a circle and that for there to be multiple meat dishes there needs to be multiple veggie dishes so the neighboring dishes are different types?</p>
Well the information about neighboring dishes being different can be considered as another “constraint”. What I mean by “constraint” is that we are limiting our view of all possible arrangements of dishes in a circle (i.e. we are looking at a “subset” of all possible arrangements ignoring the constraints)<p></p>
Can we use combinations in Q7 instead of the multiplication rule? Will I lose points?
And fully logically and mathematically correct solution will receive full credit no matter which techniques you use.
<p>How brief should we be with our justifications - should we err on the side of a thorough explanation or should we aim for a more concise explanation.</p>
<p>Giving advice on the length of justifications is tough. My general suggestion is to write as much to write enough to ensure that there are no large jumps in logic/mathematics in your solution. I guess the definition of &#34;large&#34; is different from person to person, so another way to approach this is that if you ever ask yourself the question &#34;should I explain this?&#34;, you should always assume the answer is yes. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Remember that any fully correct solution both mathematically and logically will receive full credit. So however long your proof is, as long as you fulfill the above, you should be good to go.</p>
<p>Is there an efficient timeframe needed to answer Q7? Or, in other words, would it be okay for the solution be realistically very time-consuming? </p>
<p>It differs from person to person. If you are finding the problem to be too challenging or time-consuming, it may be worthwhile to pay a visit to office hours to get some assistance from a TA.</p>

<p>Is there an efficient timeframe needed to answer Q7? Or, in other words, would it be okay for the solution be realistically very time-consuming? </p>
<p>oh whoops, my apologies for the incorrect interpretation! But yes, it is totally okay for the solution to be time consuming, as long as it guarantees that they find the faulty fork.</p>

<p>Hi everyone! We&#39;re aware that with the traveling associated with the start of the semester that many students across the university are contracting COVID-19. Of course, we strongly encourage you to stay home from lectures and recitations when you are symptomatic, and would like to make it as easy as possible for you to do so.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For lectures, we are making course lecture notes available after each lecture on the course website (cis1600.com) under the `Lectures` tab. We encourage you to go through these at your own pace if you cannot attend, and to visit office hours with any questions that you may have when you are feeling better.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For recitations, we are setting up a way for you to make up attendance credit for when you are ill. Please email your recitation TAs and the course account before your recitation letting them know that you aren&#39;t feeling well, and please type up and email solutions to the recitation problems to your recitation TAs and the course account before 11:59PM on Friday night (as that&#39;s when we&#39;ll be posting solutions). Moreover, we just wanted to remind students that they have one free recitation attendance drop. </p>
<p></p>
<p>For this week, though, we are extending this deadline to 11:59PM Sunday due to the late notice. If you have emailed us already, you can just email your recitation TAs and the course email account your solutions and you&#39;ll be good to go!!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lastly, we will not be giving extensions for HW due to illness, but remember that you have two H and two T drops throughout the semester. </p>
<p></p>
<p>If you have any questions feel free to email us at cis1600@seas.upenn.edu</p>
<p>hi im just a little bit confused on the difference between the set &#39;belongs to&#39; another set and the set is a &#39;subset&#39; of another set</p>
<p></p>
<p>so the &#39;belongs to&#39; for a set is only referring to one element and whether that element is present in the set,</p>
<p></p>
<p>while for the &#39;subset&#39; part it is when you consider a whole set and see if that whole set is within another set?</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Your definition for &#34;belongs to&#34; is correct.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One way of thinking about &#34;subset&#34; is &#34;A is a subset of B if every element of A is also an element of B&#34;. So for example, if $$A = \{1, 2\}$$ and $$B = \{1, 2, 3\}$$, then $$A \subseteq B$$, because every element of A is also an element of B. But if $$A = \{1, 4\}$$ and $$B = \{1, 2, 3\}$$ then $$A \nsubseteq B$$</p>
<p>ok that makes sense, i know for the set itself order does not matter, so for something to be considered a subset that order does not matter either as long as the elements are in the whole set</p>
<p>correct. So in my example, we can say $$\{1, 2\} \subseteq \{1, 2, 3\}$$ but it is also true that $$\{2, 1\} \subseteq \{1, 2, 3\}$$</p>

<p></p>
<p>For question 7 are we only allowed to discard the faulty fork or can we discard a group of forks that has the faulty fork in it?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
You have to successfully identify the faulty fork

<p>Should I write the list as a set? For example if I think the answer is positive integers from 2 to 17, then can I write it as {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17}? Or do I write just the numbers and not the curly braces?</p>
<p></p>
<p>And furthermore if I think that there are no elements in the set, can I just write $$\emptyset$$?</p>
<p>The HW1H FAQ says to &#34;Avoid trivial set-builder notation&#34;, but the referenced post is not visible to the class. Can we clarify what is meant by trivial set-builder notation?</p>
<p>Obviously to show the the final noodle is length 1 all you need is one example.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, if we want to prove otherwise do we need to do a full on mathematical proof or is it fine to just explain in english why its not possible for the last noodle to be of length 1? </p>
<p>For one of the questions, I found the rules of sum/difference of even and odd numbers to be useful. Do I need to prove a statement like &#34;the difference of an odd and even number is odd&#34; in my solution. Or can I just assume that it&#39;s a trivial thing we already know? I&#39;m inclining to proving them because we did an example proof for one of the rules in lecture.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p></p>
<p>I saw that on HW1T I received points off on question 1 for not distributing my expressions in parentheses, but I&#39;m feeling a bit misled right now, because in question @8_f5 on Piazza, it was said that &#34;Either was fine&#34; which I understood as parentheses are not needed. I&#39;m a bit confused because this was reason I didn&#39;t include parentheses on those two problems, but I still got points off because of it. Could somebody give me a bit more clarification on why that is?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks so much!</p>

<p>Hi! I&#39;m not sure if I am understanding this question correctly. If there are 81 meat dishes on the table, and the two dishes next to each meat dish must be vegetable dishes, wouldn&#39;t it be also 81 vegetable dishes? Is there more to this question than just that? Sorry if this is too detailed of a question or I am not allowed to ask, I just wasn&#39;t sure I understood it properly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you so much!!</p>
<p>Hello! For question 6, when the problem states &#34;in his final arrangements, he wants to use at least 1 meat dish and 1 veggie dish,&#34; does that mean that the circle has to have at least 1 veggie dish for every meat dish?</p>
<p>Does everyone who eats with the faulty fork lose all their fingers at once (meaning you have to finish testing before 8:59am), or are you able to test a portion of it, wait and see if they lose their fingers, then keep testing the portion of forks they used? Seeing the wording of the question I&#39;m leaning towards the former but just wanted to make sure. Thanks!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Also, probably a stupid question: if anyone who uses the faulty fork at exactly 8:59am loses all their fingers, why can&#39;t Ria-tini just wait until 9am to use the forks since that would be after the finger-loss time of 8:59am?</p>
<p>Would one correct way to solve Question 5 on Homework 1H be by showing a specific scenario or sequence of noodle choices where the length of the final noodle is not 1?</p>
<p>By listing the members in the set, should we use set notation {}? For example, if the members are 1, 2, 3 would we write the answer as &#34;1, 2, 3&#34; or &#34;{1, 2, 3}&#34;</p>

<p>For question 5, am I allowed to use the theorem that the sum of the first n consecutive integers (1 &#43; 2 &#43; ....... &#43; n) = n(n&#43;1)/2? </p>
On this question, it seems to me that, depending on how you do it, the final noodle could be of length 1 or it could also be not of length 1. Is that incorrect? I&#39;m not sure how it could be definitively 1 or not 1 for all cases
<p>Currently, I&#39;m trying to explore possible ways to solve this question with the 2^9 = 512 hint in mind. </p>
<p></p>
<p>One avenue is powerset (P(S) with cardinality defined as 2^n), though I&#39;m not sure what using that would mean. The subsets would be all the possible combinations of elements in S. I thought about setting up the nine TAs as the nine elements, but that doesn&#39;t seem particularly useful.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The other option I&#39;m juggling at the moment is more of a Step 1, Step 2, etc. based approach like the one we saw in lecture on Thursday. I originally thought of constructing a binary tree (9 rounds and two options per round - faulty fork or no faulty fork which would&#39;ve come out to 512 total permutations). I quickly realized this also makes no sense (it&#39;s redundant - why do the 8 other TAs need to check the fork if TA #1 already determined its status?). </p>
<p></p>
<p>Am I missing something here or am I assuming something wrong with my current two approaches? </p>

Unfortunately, we do not know what goes inside the mind of Saurabh.<div><br /></div><div>In other words, since the question is essentially asking if it is possible to get to a noodle of length 1, the randomness doesn’t really play much of a role (because you are considering all possible sequences of noodle selections that Saurabh can make).

<p>Yes, we can only take cardinality of sets. Use that fact in conjunction with the other information you know about $$x$$ to come up with an answer! you seem to have a lot of the facts nailed down. It&#39;s just about piecing them together, and for that, use the fact that we only take cardinality of sets.</p>

<p>Note that only Attempt 3 shows a correct solution for the &#34;odd numbers&#34; question. In that attempt, we can see that we will not select the number zero in steps 1 and 2. Only the second digit and the third digit can be zeroes, which is why they are placed last in our ordering of steps. But these steps also acknowledge the fact that, for example, the second digit cannot be the same as the first or fourth digit (whose digits have already been chosen), which is why there are 10 - 2 = 8 ways to perform step 3. And similar logic holds for step 4.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure I completely understand your second question, but I&#39;ll try my best to give some information that may clear things up. Steps within your process that you develop for counting CAN depend on each other, but we can only perform MR when each step has a CONSTANT number of ways of being performed. For example, in attempt 1 of the &#34;secretary&#34; question, the third step can be performed in 2 ways if, for example, Bob is President and Ann is Treasurer, 1 way if, for example, Bob is president and Clyde is secretary, or 0 ways if, for example, Clyde is president and Dan is secretary. Since this is NOT a constant value, the MR can&#39;t really be used.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Whereas, in attempt 2, since we chose the secretary first, the remaining two steps always have the same constant number of people to choose from.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For your last question, no. There can be many ways of ordering the steps. You just need to be sure that the ordering of the steps meets the above rule of that constant value for each step.</p>

<p>I am still not able to understand the mention of at least one veggie and at least one meat dish. Chef Brian already placed the 81 meat dishes on the table, so there is already more than one meat dish and with the constraint of not having the same two type dishes being adjacent to one another, then the only configuration is alternating, which seems a little too easy. Also is every meat dish the same and every veggie dish the same or are there different versions? </p>

For this question, is there a way to denote previous members of the set that you are trying to describe, like x1. This question seems recursive, so not sure how to &#34;access&#34; previous calculated x values in the set if that makes sense.
For this question, is there a way to denote previous members of the set that you are trying to describe, like x1. This question seems recursive, so not sure how to &#34;access&#34; previous calculated x values in the set if that makes sense.
<p>You should avoid doing this for sets. This is because sets are an unordered collection of values. For something like sequences (which is something we don&#39;t cover in this class), the elements have order and we can use a recursive definition.</p>
lets say we have set 2, 5, 10. Could I then just do something like x = y&#43;1 where y is a set {1, 4, 9}? I guess I&#39;m struggling how to define the given set mathematically because the numbers reference each other in their calculation.
<p>You wouldn&#39;t be able to do x = y &#43; 1 where y is that set, however, what is special about the set {1, 4, 9}? Maybe you could express that some other way.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Given my suggestion of avoiding the &#34;recursive&#34; definition, it may be helpful to try to think about a different way to define the set!</p>

<p>No, we can&#39;t quite say that $$k > 1$$ because it overlooks the case where $$x = 2$$. Since $$2 \in A$$, it can be possible that we let $$x = 2$$, and in this case, we would have $$k = 1$$. </p>
ohh then how about setting k as a positive integer greater than or equal to 1? That would solve having to include x=2. Just don’t see where the k-1 comes from.<p></p>
<p>Yes, that would be the more accurate constraint on $$k$$.</p>

<p>When disproving universal claims via counterexample, if I &#34;guessed and checked&#34; and found a counterexample out of luck/intuition, is it fine to say that I happened to find a counterexample, which disproved the claim? Or should I still resort to breaking down the claim into basic parts?

<md>Hi all,  
  
Now that some of the exercises require mathematical expressions as answers, we need to clarify what forms of answer are acceptable.  
  
In CIS 1600, all final expressions (to questions requiring mathematical expressions as answers) should be in closed form unless explicitly stated otherwise. A closed form expression is essentially a term which can be evaluated in a fixed finite number of operations. For reference, many terms we will encounter are in closed form: $$12$$, $$x^2+1$$, $$k!$$,  $$2n$$, $$\binom{n}{k}$$, $$\sum_{i = 1}^{5} i^2$$.  
  
The most likely exceptions you will encounter are summations or products whose bounds are variables. For example, $$\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (2i - 1)$$ or $$1+3+5+⋯+(2n−1)$$ would not be considered closed form, since we have a variable bound $$n$$ (the number of terms we are adding is not fixed). However, the equivalent value $$n^2$$ is closed form (we haven’t yet proven this equality, so you can’t use this post as justification if we ask for this identity, but we will likely do so in due time). Similarly, if you have nested summations, e.g. $$\sum_{i = 1}^{100} \sum_{k = 1}^{i} k$$, we would not consider this closed form since the inner summation has variable bounds.  
  
Furthermore, if you simplify an open form expression to a closed form expression, you must prove their equivalence using only material we have learned in this course. We generally strongly advise against this as it almost always entails unnecessarily complex justification. All problems in this course can be answered without doing this.  
  
We require closed form for full credit, even if it is not explicitly asked for (we will try to include a reminder in most cases where an open form solution is viable). In general, if you’re not sure whether something is closed form, feel free to ask on Piazza (as always, if you’re worried about possibly giving away too much, you can post privately) or in office hours!

<p>I think this should be acceptable so long as your case-work is exhaustive. Though this often proves to be a long and arduous process, especially compared to other equality proof techniques.</p>

<p>1. <strong>Lectures/Recitations</strong>: Please come to the lectures/recitations and don&#39;t hesitate to ask/answer questions in class. If you give an answer and if it is correct then you probably understand the material and if your answer is incorrect then it&#39;s good too as it not only gives you an opportunity to understand your mistake but also you will most likely not make the mistake in a homework or an exam.  Also, understand as much as you can in class as it will save you time outside of class and this is especially important in this course due to the fast-paced nature of the course. The sooner you lose the inhibition of speaking up in class, the better it is for you as then you can speak up in other classes too and overall this will help you get more out of the lectures in your courses.<br /><br />2. <strong>Recreating/Summarizing lectures:</strong> Soon after each lecture, try to re-create/summarize the lecture (repeating the lecture as if you are teaching someone and without looking at the notes). Note that each lecture introduces one or two key concepts and assuming that you understood what was covered in class, you should not have too much trouble re-creating what was covered. While doing so, try to figure out how you would solve the questions independently and if you have a different solution which is correct then that&#39;s great as you will then know a different way to solve the problem and more importantly, since you did it on your own, you are less likely to forget it. If your solution is not correct then it will help to understand your mistakes. <br /><br />3. <strong>Collaboration</strong>:  Please remember that unless specified otherwise,  absolutely no collaboration is allowed in homeworks. Like many other things in life, in this course, you will learn by<br />doing things on your own and not by watching others do it. You may not get a perfect score in the homeworks, but you will learn from working hard on the homework problems and that will prepare you well for the exams.  Note that you are strongly encouraged to collaborate to understand a concept.  You may want to present some lecture material to your study partner(s) and let them ask you hard questions when you are presenting the lecture or say, a solution to a homework (whose deadline has passed) solution. <br /><br />4. <strong>Homeworks</strong>: Start thinking on homework questions as soon as the homework is released. Some problems may take time and it will help if you get started early. Keep mulling on the problems while doing other chores.  Ideas will come at unexpected times, but a necessary condition for that to happen is that you have to keep thinking about the problem. Help is available -- CIS 160 staff is there to help you and we are more inclined to help if we see that you have already thought about the problem.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. <strong>Typing up solutions</strong>: We strongly encourage you to type up your homework solutions soon after you think you have solved the question. It<br />happens many times that one finds mistakes when writing the solutions, so this will give you more time to fix your mistakes, if any. Also, spreading out the work of writing over a few days can save you a lot of time on the day/night before the homework is due. In short, don&#39;t leave typing the solutions until the very end.</p>
<p></p>
<p>6. <strong>History: </strong>If you are worried about how you will do in CIS 160, keep in mind that each year about 500 students complete CIS 160 successfully and eventually end up having great careers. You will too!</p>

It’s hard to say without knowing what the rest of your proof looks like, but the general advice is that if you have to ask yourself whether or not to prove something, it’s always safer to just prove it.

<p></p>
<p>Question: How many strings are there of four lowercase letters that have the letter x in them? </p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks, </p>
<p>$$26^4 - 25^4$$ is the correct answer.</p>
<p>The lecture notes said the answer should be 4 x 26^3.</p>
<p>That solution is meant to be the one referenced by the &#34;Incorrect Solution&#34; note.</p>
<p>The lecture notes said the answer should be 4 x 26^3.</p>
<p>Ahh! Thanks!</p>
<p>The lecture notes said the answer should be 4 x 26^3.</p>
<p>Can you explain why 4 · 26^3 is incorrect? </p>
<p>The lecture notes said the answer should be 4 x 26^3.</p>
<p>Sure. The procedure to get this answer is as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Step 1: Choose one spot to place the x</p>
<p>Step 2: Choose a letter for one of the remaining spots</p>
<p>Step 3: Choose a letter for one of the remaining spots</p>
<p>Step 4: Choose a letter for the last available spot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let&#39;s consider two <strong>distinct</strong> &#34;paths&#34; through this procedure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Suppose in step 1, I place the x in the first slot. Now, in step 2, let&#39;s suppose we are looking at the second slot, and suppose we happen to choose the letter x for that slot as well. In step 3, suppose we place a y in the third slot. And suppose in step 4, we place a z in the last slot. Then the string we have constructed is &#34;xxyz&#34;.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, suppose in step 1, I place the x in the <strong>second</strong> slot. Now, in step 2, we find an available slot and choose a letter for it. So suppose we look at the first slot and happen to choose the letter x. In step 3, suppose we place a y in the third slot. And suppose in step 4, we place a z in the last slot. Then the string we have constructed is again &#34;xxyz&#34;.<br /><br />So we see that we have constructed the same string twice by following <strong>distinct </strong>&#34;paths&#34; in the procedure. This is an indication that we have overcounted, and the answer is incorrect.</p>

<p>Hi, I was wondering how question 3 from the homework would be different if the cars were indistinguishable. I&#39;m thinking that it would be 8 choose 3, but I&#39;m not too sure. Could I please get some insight? Thank you!</p>
<p>Hi, I was wondering how question 3 from the homework would be different if the cars were indistinguishable. I&#39;m thinking that it would be 8 choose 3, but I&#39;m not too sure. Could I please get some insight? Thank you!</p>
<p>As an example, suppose three of the cars are called $$A$$, $$B$$ and $$C$$ (distinguishable), and suppose the three interests are called $$x$$, $$y$$, and $$z$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then one possible distribution of these cars would be $$A$$ to $$x$$, $$B$$ to $$y$$ and $$C$$ to $$z$$. But clearly, there are many more ways to distribute the cars.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If, however, the cars were indistinguishable, then we could all give them the same name of $$A$$. And the <span style="text-decoration:underline">only</span> way to distribute the cars now would be $$A$$ to $$x$$, $$A$$ to $$y$$ and $$A$$ to $$z$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>As a reminder, <strong>ALL</strong> eight cars must be distributed amongst his interests.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting. The way in which i was doing it I don&#39;t think all the cars were being distributed?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here&#39;s the procedure that I created for indistinguishable:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Contestant 1 gets a car: 8 possibilites</p>
<p>Contestant 2 gets a car: 8 possibilites</p>
<p>Contestant 3 gets a car: 8 possibilites</p>
<p></p>
<p>Contestant 1 gets 0 cars: 8^2 possibilites</p>
<p>Contestant 2 gets 0 cars: 8^2 possibilites</p>
<p>Contestant 3 gets 0 cars: 8^2 possibilites</p>
<p></p>
<p>Contestant 1 gets all cars: 1 possibility</p>
<p>Contestant 2 gets all cars: 1 possibility</p>
<p>Contestant 3 gets all cars: 1 possibility</p>
<p></p>
<p>So the total ways would be 8^3 - (3 x 8^2 - 3)?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot comment on the correctness of your solution/answer. However, if you have any doubts regarding the problem and/or your solution, then it would be a good idea to go to office hours to speak with a TA in person!</p>

<p>So the total ways would be 8^3 - (3 x 8^2 - 3)?</p>
<p></p>
<p>I understand that, but I was just wondering since this is a not exactly a homework problem as I have changed the conditions for the problem and created a new hypothetical scenario to clarify the difference between indistinguishable and distinguishable. No worries though, I appreciate it.</p>

<p>I was reviewing HW2T, I could follow the justifications for 1b until I got to &#34;then y \subseteq Y&#34; Aren&#39;t we trying to prove that y \subseteq X?</p>
<p>I thought this was an error because for the next part, the solution goes &#34;Thus x \subseteq Y and hence X \subseteq Y&#34;. I&#39;m sorry if the solutions are actually correct and I don&#39;t get it.</p>

In Q3, how do I make sure that the ordering of cars, ordering of contestants, and placing of the dividers are independent steps? Is that guaranteed by the symmetry of the tree of possibilities (i.e. for each x, there are y number of ways and for each of that way there are z number of ways)? If so, can we use that as our justification in in the hw? thanks.

<p>I&#39;m not really sure what you mean by &#34;dividers&#34;, but regardless, it seems like you are already far along in your thought process for this problem, so it may be a better idea to visit office hours to discuss that thought process with a TA in person. As it stands, it is hard to answer your current question without knowing the rest of your solution.</p>

<p>Hi, I read @202, and just wanted to confirm for Q6 on HW2H that a closed form expression is required as an answer for full credit. I know the post says that closed form is the default, but it also says that a reminder would usually be included for cases where an open form solution is viable and it seems like for Q6 an open form solution at the very least may <em>seem </em>viable based on the potential summation of a number of elements dependent on <em>n</em>.</p>

<p>For Q1, while proving by contradiction, could I also use an *example to show that the premises contradict each other? Or do I have to use some generalized procedures each time I prove by contradiction?</p>
<p></p>
<p>**To clarify, in class we proved that if 3n &#43; 2 is odd then n is odd is true by contradiction, where we assumed that 3n &#43; 2 is odd and n is even. We used some generalized procedures to show the premises contradict. However, could we have also said &#34;Let n = 2, 3(2) &#43; 2 = 8, which is even, so the premise that 3n &#43; 2 is odd is contradicted, so we proved the original claim to be true&#34;?</p>

If d&lt;0 and t&gt;0 we get dt &lt; 0. Multiplying an inequality by dt means that we are multiplying it by a negative value. According to the general rules of inequality, if we multiply an inequality with a negative value, then the inequality sign changes/reverses. This is not something that was discussed in the lecture but I want to use it for my hw solution. Do I have to prove this too?

Piazza is a Q&A platform designed to get you great answers from classmates and instructors fast. We've put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started:

<ol style="margin:0;padding:0;list-style-position:inside;"> <li style="margin:0;padding:0"><strong>Ask questions!</strong>

The best way to get answers is to ask questions! Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are).

</li><li style="margin:0;padding:0"><strong>Edit questions and answers wiki-style.</strong>

Think of Piazza as a Q&A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single <strong>students' answer</strong> that students can edit collectively (and a single <strong>instructors’ answer</strong> for instructors).

</li><li style="margin:0;padding:0"> <strong>Add a followup to comment or ask further questions.</strong>

To comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a <strong>followup discussion</strong>. Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&A above.

</li><li style="margin:0;padding:0"> <strong>Go anonymous.</strong>

Shy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously.

</li><li style="margin:0;padding:0"> <strong>Tag your posts.</strong>

It's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a “#” before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag.

</li><li style="margin:0;padding:0"> <strong>Format code and equations.</strong>

Adding a code snippet? Click the <strong>pre</strong> or <strong>tt</strong> button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text. 
Mathematical equation? Click the <strong>Fx</strong> button to access the LaTeX editor to build a nicely formatted equation.

</li><li style="margin:0;padding:0"> <strong>View and download class details and resources.</strong> </li></ol>

Click the <strong>Course Page</strong> button in your top bar to access the class syllabus, staff contact information, office hours details, and course resources—all in one place!

<md>Hi everyone and welcome to CIS 1600! The first homework will be posted later today, and as such we wanted to post the following information about office hours.

The important things to know are covered below, but for more detailed information about when office hours are, please consult the schedule found on the [course website](/cis1600.com).

Rajiv will host his office hours weekly on Tuesdays from 12-1PM as well as on Thursdays from 3-4PM in **Levine 512**.

The TAs will host all of their office hours in **Greenberg Lounge** (Skirkanich 114) Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays from 4-10PM, Thursdays from 4-6PM, and weekends from 12-2PM.

**Note:** For this coming week we have limited room availability in Greenberg Lounge due to Labor Day. As such, in person office hours will be available in Greenberg Lounge only on Tuesday from 8-10PM and Wednesday from 4-10PM. All other office hours posted on the course calendar will be conducted via Zoom (paste your zoom link in the question description)</md>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p><br />Welcome to CIS 1600!</p>
<p><br />The first homework assignment is now available on the course website and will be due at 11:59 PM on Wednesday, August 31st. To submit the assignment, create <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gradescope.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Gradescope account</a> and join our course (course code <b>E7VVGZ</b>). For all of the assignments, there is a strict policy on collaboration. <i>There is </i><b><i>no collaboration</i></b><i> on the homework assignments at all. The only materials you may reference when writing homework solutions are course materials (lecture notes, homework solutions, and recitation guides). </i></p>
<p></p>
<p><br />In CIS 1600, we require all homeworks to be typeset in<a target="_blank" href="https://www.latex-project.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> LaTeX</a> using the templates provided on the course website. We recommend using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.overleaf.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Overleaf</a>. One of our TAs Ishaan has recorded <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmQuOprb7Pc" rel="noopener noreferrer">a quick tutorial that should get you up to speed for working on homework 1T</a>, and we will do another overview in recitation this week. <b><i>For homework 1T only</i></b>, if you do not yet feel comfortable using LaTeX you may submit the homework problems as a <i>legible</i> PDF created however you feel most comfortable.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">The first office hours are today from 4 PM to 10 PM. For a full list of office hours times and the location, see our website at <a target="_blank" href="http://cis1600.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">cis1600.com</a>. See @6 for more infomation regarding Office Hours. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also released today is a short <i>graded</i> quiz on our course policies. The policies are all available at <a target="_blank" href="http://cis1600.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">cis1600.com</a>, and the quiz just lets us know that you have read the course policies and understand what is and isn’t allowed when forming study groups with other students. This quiz is also due Wednesday at 11:59 pm, but if you are reading this after joining the course late, we have enabled late submissions with no penalty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Finally, we hope that everyone will have a great semester, and we look forward to interacting with all of you in person :)<br /><br /></p>
<p>In the 3rd problem do you want us to justify our answer via mathematical proofs or via words and explanation?</p>
Either is fine!
<p>can we submit multiple times on gradescope until the deadline?</p>
<p>yep</p>

<p>In problem 1, is there a difference between the statements &#34;The students want to make delicious pasta,&#34; and &#34;the students all want to make delicious pasta&#34; (from part b)?</p>
No. No difference.
<p>I want to confirm in question 2 part b that the first part of the proposition is supposed to say if p and not p.</p>
Yes. It is correct as written.
<p>Hi, I wonder how should I fill in my recitation number in the homework. Thanks.</p>
<p>In the template, you will see</p>
<pre>
\newcommand{\MyRecitation}{X}</pre>
<p>You should replace the X with your recitation number. For example, it could look something like this:</p>
<p></p>
<pre>
\newcommand{\MyRecitation}{202}</pre>
<p>For question one, do we have to distribute any expressions in parentheses or just leave them as is?</p>
<p>Either is fine.</p>
<p>How do we save our LaTeX file so that we can edit later (or does it autosave)?</p>
<p>The LaTeX file will auto-save on Overleaf.</p>
<p>For question 2a how am I supposed to state my final solution. In LaTeX when I create another &#34;\item&#34; after the first table, my answer has a &#34;(b)&#34; in front of it, and it offsets the next part of the question to (c) instead of (b)</p>
<p>You can write below the truth table and before part (b). So you can write in the space after the </p>
<pre>
\end{tabular}</pre>
<p>and before the</p>
<pre>
\item</pre>
<p>For Q3, do all the TAs have a single piece of pasta from the 5 total pieces?</p>
<p>Each of the TAs has exactly one piece of pasta. But each of those pieces of pasta come from the 5 total pieces.</p>
<p>Which symbol should we use for not: ˜ or ¬ ?</p>
<p>Either is fine, but in this class, we typically use $$\lnot$$</p>
<p>For necessary conditions should we write it as</p>
<p></p>
<p>¬p → ¬q or q → p</p>
<p></p>
<p>Or are both forms okay?</p>
<p>Any logically correct solution will receive credit.</p>
<p>Can you please provide an example annotation of &#34;if A or B then not C&#34;</p>
<p>Please see the LaTeX Demo video linked in @7. At around the ~11:47 mark, we cover some of the LaTeX commands for logical operators.</p>
<p>Can you please provide an example annotation of &#34;if A or B then not C&#34;</p>
<p>I understand how to make symbols. I am more confused on the math side of how to construct the equations. </p>
<p>Can you please provide an example annotation of &#34;if A or B then not C&#34;</p>
<p>This may be a good question for office hours. We have office hours going on now, and will continue running until 10PM today.</p>

<p>Should 1f be written as one logical statement or split into two?</p>
<p>This is your decision. Any logically correct solution will receive credit.</p>
<p>Where and when is office hours today?</p>
<p>Is it in Greenberg Loungs Skirkanich 114 right now?</p>
<p>Where and when is office hours today?</p>
<p>No. Office hours are being held virtually on OHQ now until 8PM. Then they will be in Greenberg starting at 8PM until 10PM.</p>
<p>Is there any logical difference between not and negation (\bar vs \lnot)?</p>
<p>No. They are the same.</p>
<p>Are we permitted to use the internet to look up a LaTeX command? </p>
<p>please refer to the resources listed here for help with LaTeX: <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1600/current/resources.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1600/current/resources.html</a></p>

<p>Hi! </p>
<p></p>
<p>At the top of the document it says that we should show all work. Question 1 specifies no work is needed. However, for question 2 I wasn&#39;t too sure how to show work as its a table with values within the table. Therefore, I was slightly confused on how to show work. Could you please provide some insight?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p dir="ltr">Hi All,</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">We have released homework 1H. It will be due at <strong>11:59pm on Monday. </strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Finally, quick reminder that for this and all future homework assignments you are <b>REQUIRED</b> to typeset the homework using LaTeX. If you have not already watched it, I highly recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmQuOprb7Pc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our TA Ishaan’s LaTeX introduction video</a>, and we will also be discussing a little bit more about LaTeX in the first recitation.</p>

<p dir="ltr"></p>
<p>just a question from lecture. if the empty set is always an element of a set, then why is it not counted in the cardinality of the set? like |{1,2,3}| = 3, not 4 because you don&#39;t count the empty set....</p>
<p>The empty set is <strong>not </strong>always an element of a set. For example, $$\emptyset \notin \{1, 2, 3\}$$ but $$\emptyset \in \{1, \emptyset\}$$. Perhaps you meant to be speaking about subsets (which is a bit different than just elements)!</p>
<p>Is there recitation this week?</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>For problem 2a on the homework, are the 2 earrings in an &#34;earring pair&#34; necessarily identical?</p>
<p>Yes. The two earrings within a pair are identical.</p>
<p>In problem 1a iii) do y and z have to be different integers, or can they have the same value?</p>
<p>they can be the same!</p>
<p>In problem 1a iii) do y and z have to be different integers, or can they have the same value?</p>
<p>for the same problem, is zero in the set of positive integers?</p>
<p>In problem 1a iii) do y and z have to be different integers, or can they have the same value?</p>
No
<p>For problem 2, should the 7 grains of pasta in one earring be unique to each other or can there exist for example 2 linguine in one earing? Thanks.</p>
<p>they need not be unique. So an earring can have 2 linguini</p>
<p>for question 5, can two noodles of the same length be subtracted such that no new noodle is created (or noodle of length 0)</p>
<p>but can you use a noodle that has been created afterward?</p>
<p>for question 5, can two noodles of the same length be subtracted such that no new noodle is created (or noodle of length 0)</p>
<p>Yes, two noodles of the same length can be subtracted. In this case, we would remove those noodles and replace them with one noodle of length 0.</p>
<p>for question 5, can two noodles of the same length be subtracted such that no new noodle is created (or noodle of length 0)</p>
<p>i just want to clarify exactly what the question is asking. Is it asking whether Saurabh-violi can be sure that the final noodle will always be length 1 regardless of how the noodles are picked and subtracted?</p>
<p>for question 5, can two noodles of the same length be subtracted such that no new noodle is created (or noodle of length 0)</p>
<p>Does a noodle of length 0 still count as a noodle?</p>
<p>Can we leave our answers as a number to an exponent (say $$2^{17}$$), or do we need to calculate the exact numerical solution?</p>
<p>no need to reduce your answers to the exact value. So something like $$2^{17}$$ would be fine.</p>
<p>Can 1) iv) have multiple correct answers?</p>
<p>No. 1a) iv) has only one correct answer.</p>
<p>Are office hours in-person today?</p>
<p>OH will be held on zoom today.</p>
<p>For question 1(a), should we list the elements of the sets using set notation? </p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>Is zero considered a positive integer?</p>
<p>no.</p>
<p>Just to clarify, for question 2, the same type of pasta can be used multiple times to make an earring, right? For example, you can do penne-penne-penne. </p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>Is question 5 asking if Saurabh will always end up with a single noodle of length 1, or asking if it is possible for Saurabh to end up with a noodle of length 1?</p>
<p>It is asking if it is possible for Saurabh to end up with a noodle of length 1</p>
<p>In question 2(a), for each pair of earrings, do both earrings have to be the same or can they be different from each other?</p>
<p>both earrings are the same within a pair.</p>
In question 4, does it mean that the colors can repeat for the vertical stripes but not the horizontal ones?
<p>Colors are allowed to repeat. As shown in the diagram, there are two black horizontal stripes (hence, in this case, the color black is repeated), and there are two red vertical stripes.</p>
<p>how do i type curly braces in overleaf</p>
<pre>
\{ stuff inside curly braces \}</pre>
For Q2, does F-P-P equal P-P-F?
<p>No. These would be considered different.</p>
<p>How can I type these i ii iii iiii in Latex?</p>
<p><img src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7ga3way2da7hz%2F76f3517ab03f9e17ff79873a2713802664f786266c7b3153f0348070ab1e1a83%2Fimage.png" alt="image.png" /></p>
<p>You get those from a &#34;nested enumeration&#34;. So something like this:</p>
<p></p>
<pre>
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 	this is a
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item 	this is i
		\item 	this is ii
		\item 	this is iii
		\item   this is iv
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}</pre>
<p>For 1a, should we interpret the &#34;members of the set&#34; as the elements in set X or should write out the set that X is equivalent to, including the braces?</p>
<p>you can include the braces.</p>
<p>In Question 2a do we have unlimited supply of all 350 types of pastas or do we have a fixed number of quantity of all types to be used to make earrings? <br />Like is it possible to create a pair of earring like all 7 grains of Penne, then another pair of earrling with 6 grains of Penne and one Fettuccine and so on, so we can use Penne as many times as we want right?</p>
Correct
<p>what exactly does question 7 mean by how she should organize testing? Are we trying to minimize the amount of time it takes to identify the fault fork.... or save the greatest number of people&#39;s fingers? </p>
<p>You need to come up with a method to ensure that you have found the faulty fork. Keep in mind that if someone uses the faulty fork, they will lose their fingers at exactly 8:59.</p>
<p>what exactly does question 7 mean by how she should organize testing? Are we trying to minimize the amount of time it takes to identify the fault fork.... or save the greatest number of people&#39;s fingers? </p>
<p>sure, but you still need to come up with a method to assure that you have found the faulty fork.</p>

<p>For 2 (b) (c) (d), is it asking us the number of unique earring pairs or simply earring pairs no matter unique or not?</p>
<p>Earrings within a pair are identical to each other. Does this help?</p>
<p></p>
<p>For 2 (b) (c) (d), is it asking us the number of unique earring pairs or simply earring pairs no matter unique or not?</p>
<p>I mean (a) asks &#34;How many UNIQUE earring pairs can the Master of Linguine create?&#34; but the other questions do not mention &#34;UNIQUE.&#34; So do we have to find out the unique pairs or simply pairs both unique and not?</p>
<p>For 2 (b) (c) (d), is it asking us the number of unique earring pairs or simply earring pairs no matter unique or not?</p>
<p>Your final answer for all questions should be the number of unique earring pairs for the given question.</p>

<p>For question 6. when it says that for each, the dishes next to it are a different type, does that mean if the dish is a meat dish, its neighborings have to be veggie dishes and vice versa?</p>
<md>That's true.</md>
<p>Can you use summations in set builder notation?</p>
yeah
<p>For question 5, what happens to the new noodle that Saurabh makes after selecting two random noodles? Does he use this new noodle and selects another random noodle and creates another noodle with the difference between the two?</p>
The new noodle gets added to the group of noodles. And then he chooses two noodles from the group (one of which COULD be the new noodle but doesn’t have to be)
<p>In which office are the OH today?</p>
I think they are online today
<p>For question 4 what does &#34;any two stripes that have the same color cannot share a long edge&#34; mean? I see red can be repeated on the vertical stripes and black was repeated on the bottom stripes. </p>
<p>So the same color cannot be next to each other in the bottom stripes and they cannot be next to each other in the top stripes?</p>
<p>In the answer to the first question of this post (<a href="/class/l6vqf2f5p8e6c1/post/17_f29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://piazza.com/class/l6vqf2f5p8e6c1/post/17_f29)</a>, the TA says &#34;If you wish to prove the statement wrong, though, <strong>you have to consider all “examples”</strong>&#34;. What does &#34;consider all examples&#34; exactly mean? What are the examples and exactly how many examples we will have to consider?</p>
<p>I&#39;m not exactly sure what they mean by &#34;all examples&#34;, but if I had to venture a guess, they were trying to say that in order to disprove the statement, you would have to consider all possible noodle manipulations that Saurabh can do (i.e. every sequence of choices of pairs of noodles he can make) and show that none of them result in a noodle of length 1. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Should we assume commonly used theorems as axioms or should they be stated as theorems? Are we allowed to use theorems in our proofs?</p>
If we have seen the theorem being used in class, recitation or a previous HW, then you can cite it. Else, you should be proving said theorem/axiom (not just stating it)
<p>For question 6 is there a specific dish (meat or vegetable) that Brian wants to end his arrangement on? </p>
<p>it doesn&#39;t make sense to end a circle</p>
<p>Can all of question 2 be solved using the multiplicative rule used in class, or do some require other methods used in combinatorics, like casework?</p>
<p>Just to clarify, I am generally asking about any methods not discussed in class, casework is just one specific method.</p>
<p>Can all of question 2 be solved using the multiplicative rule used in class, or do some require other methods used in combinatorics, like casework?</p>
<p>But can the problems be solved without it?</p>
<p>Can all of question 2 be solved using the multiplicative rule used in class, or do some require other methods used in combinatorics, like casework?</p>
All problems can be solved using material covered in lecture
<p>For set builder notation, can we use words instead of the notation? For example, {x| x is an odd integer and a multiple of 7 that is less than 100}?</p>
sure
<p>Do I have to prove the associative property for addition or can I assume it as an axiom?</p>
You can assume this
<p>In question 6 do we know the total number of dishes on the table?</p>
No. That is what you are trying to solve for.
<p>In question 6, what is the importance of there needing to be at least 1 meat dish and 1 veggie dish? Isn&#39;t it implied that a singular dish can&#39;t be a circle and that for there to be multiple meat dishes there needs to be multiple veggie dishes so the neighboring dishes are different types?</p>
The “importance” is somewhat subjective, I suppose. However, it is a critical piece of information for the problem. Think of it as a “constraint” on the set of all possible arrangements. How you choose to use this information is something we want you to think about, and something to argue in your solution/proof.

Isn&#39;t it implied that a singular dish can&#39;t be a circle and that for there to be multiple meat dishes there needs to be multiple veggie dishes so the neighboring dishes are different types?</p>
<p>Without the &#34;at least&#34; information, wouldn&#39;t the set all of arrangments still be the same? You can&#39;t have all meat or all veggie. What do you mean by contraint? </p>
<p>In question 6, what is the importance of there needing to be at least 1 meat dish and 1 veggie dish? Isn&#39;t it implied that a singular dish can&#39;t be a circle and that for there to be multiple meat dishes there needs to be multiple veggie dishes so the neighboring dishes are different types?</p>
Well the information about neighboring dishes being different can be considered as another “constraint”. What I mean by “constraint” is that we are limiting our view of all possible arrangements of dishes in a circle (i.e. we are looking at a “subset” of all possible arrangements ignoring the constraints)<p></p>
Can we use combinations in Q7 instead of the multiplication rule? Will I lose points?
And fully logically and mathematically correct solution will receive full credit no matter which techniques you use.
<p>How brief should we be with our justifications - should we err on the side of a thorough explanation or should we aim for a more concise explanation.</p>
<p>Giving advice on the length of justifications is tough. My general suggestion is to write as much to write enough to ensure that there are no large jumps in logic/mathematics in your solution. I guess the definition of &#34;large&#34; is different from person to person, so another way to approach this is that if you ever ask yourself the question &#34;should I explain this?&#34;, you should always assume the answer is yes. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Remember that any fully correct solution both mathematically and logically will receive full credit. So however long your proof is, as long as you fulfill the above, you should be good to go.</p>
<p>Is there an efficient timeframe needed to answer Q7? Or, in other words, would it be okay for the solution be realistically very time-consuming? </p>
<p>It differs from person to person. If you are finding the problem to be too challenging or time-consuming, it may be worthwhile to pay a visit to office hours to get some assistance from a TA.</p>
<p>Is there an efficient timeframe needed to answer Q7? Or, in other words, would it be okay for the solution be realistically very time-consuming? </p>
<p>To clarify what I meant - would it be okay for the solution to find the faulty fork to be very time-consuming for the TA&#39;s? </p>
<p>Is there an efficient timeframe needed to answer Q7? Or, in other words, would it be okay for the solution be realistically very time-consuming? </p>
<p>oh whoops, my apologies for the incorrect interpretation! But yes, it is totally okay for the solution to be time consuming, as long as it guarantees that they find the faulty fork.</p>

<p>Are we allowed to use induction to justify our answers to the problems on HW1H, even though we haven&#39;t coverd induction yet in class?</p>
<p>you must prove anything that you choose to use that was not covered in class. So that would mean you would have to prove induction (which doesn&#39;t sound fun). So I would encourage avoiding induction for this problem set.</p>

<p>Hi everyone! We&#39;re aware that with the traveling associated with the start of the semester that many students across the university are contracting COVID-19. Of course, we strongly encourage you to stay home from lectures and recitations when you are symptomatic, and would like to make it as easy as possible for you to do so.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For lectures, we are making course lecture notes available after each lecture on the course website (cis1600.com) under the `Lectures` tab. We encourage you to go through these at your own pace if you cannot attend, and to visit office hours with any questions that you may have when you are feeling better.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For recitations, we are setting up a way for you to make up attendance credit for when you are ill. Please email your recitation TAs and the course account before your recitation letting them know that you aren&#39;t feeling well, and please type up and email solutions to the recitation problems to your recitation TAs and the course account before 11:59PM on Friday night (as that&#39;s when we&#39;ll be posting solutions). Moreover, we just wanted to remind students that they have one free recitation attendance drop. </p>
<p></p>
<p>For this week, though, we are extending this deadline to 11:59PM Sunday due to the late notice. If you have emailed us already, you can just email your recitation TAs and the course email account your solutions and you&#39;ll be good to go!!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lastly, we will not be giving extensions for HW due to illness, but remember that you have two H and two T drops throughout the semester. </p>
<p></p>
<p>If you have any questions feel free to email us at cis1600@seas.upenn.edu</p>
<p>hi im just a little bit confused on the difference between the set &#39;belongs to&#39; another set and the set is a &#39;subset&#39; of another set</p>
<p></p>
<p>so the &#39;belongs to&#39; for a set is only referring to one element and whether that element is present in the set,</p>
<p></p>
<p>while for the &#39;subset&#39; part it is when you consider a whole set and see if that whole set is within another set?</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Your definition for &#34;belongs to&#34; is correct.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One way of thinking about &#34;subset&#34; is &#34;A is a subset of B if every element of A is also an element of B&#34;. So for example, if $$A = \{1, 2\}$$ and $$B = \{1, 2, 3\}$$, then $$A \subseteq B$$, because every element of A is also an element of B. But if $$A = \{1, 4\}$$ and $$B = \{1, 2, 3\}$$ then $$A \nsubseteq B$$</p>
<p>ok that makes sense, i know for the set itself order does not matter, so for something to be considered a subset that order does not matter either as long as the elements are in the whole set</p>
<p>correct. So in my example, we can say $$\{1, 2\} \subseteq \{1, 2, 3\}$$ but it is also true that $$\{2, 1\} \subseteq \{1, 2, 3\}$$</p>

<p>Sorry if you are seeing this again but I think my question got lost in the FAQ. Can we use summation as a condition for set builder notation?</p>
<p>Hello course staff!</p>
<p></p>
<p>I hope you are well. I am very on the policy for office hours right now. No TA was in Skirkanch 114, but when I joined the Office Hours queue virtually, my question was denied. Where should I go for office hours today?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
Would I need to write a proof for even &#43; even = even, odd &#43; odd = even, odd &#43; even = odd, etc. or can I treat those like a theorem?
<p>I don&#39;t have a specific question about the homework, theres just two problems I have only a vague idea how to do. Should I still go to office hours and ask for help? Or is this something I need to figure out on my own and I can return with more focused questions? </p>

<p>Should I write the list as a set? For example if I think the answer is positive integers from 2 to 17, then can I write it as {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17}? Or do I write just the numbers and not the curly braces?</p>

<p>And furthermore if I think that there are no elements in the set, can I just write $$\emptyset$$?</p>
<p>The HW1H FAQ says to &#34;Avoid trivial set-builder notation&#34;, but the referenced post is not visible to the class. Can we clarify what is meant by trivial set-builder notation?</p>
<p>Obviously to show the the final noodle is length 1 all you need is one example.</p>

<p>However, if we want to prove otherwise do we need to do a full on mathematical proof or is it fine to just explain in english why its not possible for the last noodle to be of length 1? </p>
<p>For one of the questions, I found the rules of sum/difference of even and odd numbers to be useful. Do I need to prove a statement like &#34;the difference of an odd and even number is odd&#34; in my solution. Or can I just assume that it&#39;s a trivial thing we already know? I&#39;m inclining to proving them because we did an example proof for one of the rules in lecture.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p></p>
<p>I saw that on HW1T I received points off on question 1 for not distributing my expressions in parentheses, but I&#39;m feeling a bit misled right now, because in question @8_f5 on Piazza, it was said that &#34;Either was fine&#34; which I understood as parentheses are not needed. I&#39;m a bit confused because this was reason I didn&#39;t include parentheses on those two problems, but I still got points off because of it. Could somebody give me a bit more clarification on why that is?</p>

<p>Hi! I&#39;m not sure if I am understanding this question correctly. If there are 81 meat dishes on the table, and the two dishes next to each meat dish must be vegetable dishes, wouldn&#39;t it be also 81 vegetable dishes? Is there more to this question than just that? Sorry if this is too detailed of a question or I am not allowed to ask, I just wasn&#39;t sure I understood it properly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you so much!!</p>
<p>Hello! For question 6, when the problem states &#34;in his final arrangements, he wants to use at least 1 meat dish and 1 veggie dish,&#34; does that mean that the circle has to have at least 1 veggie dish for every meat dish?</p>
<p>Does everyone who eats with the faulty fork lose all their fingers at once (meaning you have to finish testing before 8:59am), or are you able to test a portion of it, wait and see if they lose their fingers, then keep testing the portion of forks they used? Seeing the wording of the question I&#39;m leaning towards the former but just wanted to make sure. Thanks!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Also, probably a stupid question: if anyone who uses the faulty fork at exactly 8:59am loses all their fingers, why can&#39;t Ria-tini just wait until 9am to use the forks since that would be after the finger-loss time of 8:59am?</p>
<p>Would one correct way to solve Question 5 on Homework 1H be by showing a specific scenario or sequence of noodle choices where the length of the final noodle is not 1?</p>
<p>By listing the members in the set, should we use set notation {}? For example, if the members are 1, 2, 3 would we write the answer as &#34;1, 2, 3&#34; or &#34;{1, 2, 3}&#34;</p>

On this question, it seems to me that, depending on how you do it, the final noodle could be of length 1 or it could also be not of length 1. Is that incorrect? I&#39;m not sure how it could be definitively 1 or not 1 for all cases
<p>Currently, I&#39;m trying to explore possible ways to solve this question with the 2^9 = 512 hint in mind. </p>
<p></p>
<p>One avenue is powerset (P(S) with cardinality defined as 2^n), though I&#39;m not sure what using that would mean. The subsets would be all the possible combinations of elements in S. I thought about setting up the nine TAs as the nine elements, but that doesn&#39;t seem particularly useful.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The other option I&#39;m juggling at the moment is more of a Step 1, Step 2, etc. based approach like the one we saw in lecture on Thursday. I originally thought of constructing a binary tree (9 rounds and two options per round - faulty fork or no faulty fork which would&#39;ve come out to 512 total permutations). I quickly realized this also makes no sense (it&#39;s redundant - why do the 8 other TAs need to check the fork if TA #1 already determined its status?). </p>

<p>Am I missing something here or am I assuming something wrong with my current two approaches? </p>

Unfortunately, we do not know what goes inside the mind of Saurabh.<div><br /></div><div>In other words, since the question is essentially asking if it is possible to get to a noodle of length 1, the randomness doesn’t really play much of a role (because you are considering all possible sequences of noodle selections that Saurabh can make).

<p>Yes, we can only take cardinality of sets. Use that fact in conjunction with the other information you know about $$x$$ to come up with an answer! you seem to have a lot of the facts nailed down. It&#39;s just about piecing them together, and for that, use the fact that we only take cardinality of sets.</p>

<p>Is it that in a question in which there are multiple ways of performing the steps, only one sequence of steps allows multiplication rule to be applied and other sequences of events do not? thank you.</p>
<p>Note that only Attempt 3 shows a correct solution for the &#34;odd numbers&#34; question. In that attempt, we can see that we will not select the number zero in steps 1 and 2. Only the second digit and the third digit can be zeroes, which is why they are placed last in our ordering of steps. But these steps also acknowledge the fact that, for example, the second digit cannot be the same as the first or fourth digit (whose digits have already been chosen), which is why there are 10 - 2 = 8 ways to perform step 3. And similar logic holds for step 4.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure I completely understand your second question, but I&#39;ll try my best to give some information that may clear things up. Steps within your process that you develop for counting CAN depend on each other, but we can only perform MR when each step has a CONSTANT number of ways of being performed. For example, in attempt 1 of the &#34;secretary&#34; question, the third step can be performed in 2 ways if, for example, Bob is President and Ann is Treasurer, 1 way if, for example, Bob is president and Clyde is secretary, or 0 ways if, for example, Clyde is president and Dan is secretary. Since this is NOT a constant value, the MR can&#39;t really be used.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Whereas, in attempt 2, since we chose the secretary first, the remaining two steps always have the same constant number of people to choose from.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For your last question, no. There can be many ways of ordering the steps. You just need to be sure that the ordering of the steps meets the above rule of that constant value for each step.</p>

<p>hope that made a bit of sense!</p>

<p>I am still not able to understand the mention of at least one veggie and at least one meat dish. Chef Brian already placed the 81 meat dishes on the table, so there is already more than one meat dish and with the constraint of not having the same two type dishes being adjacent to one another, then the only configuration is alternating, which seems a little too easy. Also is every meat dish the same and every veggie dish the same or are there different versions? </p>

For this question, is there a way to denote previous members of the set that you are trying to describe, like x1. This question seems recursive, so not sure how to &#34;access&#34; previous calculated x values in the set if that makes sense.
For this question, is there a way to denote previous members of the set that you are trying to describe, like x1. This question seems recursive, so not sure how to &#34;access&#34; previous calculated x values in the set if that makes sense.
<p>You should avoid doing this for sets. This is because sets are an unordered collection of values. For something like sequences (which is something we don&#39;t cover in this class), the elements have order and we can use a recursive definition.</p>
lets say we have set 2, 5, 10. Could I then just do something like x = y&#43;1 where y is a set {1, 4, 9}? I guess I&#39;m struggling how to define the given set mathematically because the numbers reference each other in their calculation.
<p>You wouldn&#39;t be able to do x = y &#43; 1 where y is that set, however, what is special about the set {1, 4, 9}? Maybe you could express that some other way.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Given my suggestion of avoiding the &#34;recursive&#34; definition, it may be helpful to try to think about a different way to define the set!</p>

<p>No, we can&#39;t quite say that $$k > 1$$ because it overlooks the case where $$x = 2$$. Since $$2 \in A$$, it can be possible that we let $$x = 2$$, and in this case, we would have $$k = 1$$. </p>
ohh then how about setting k as a positive integer greater than or equal to 1? That would solve having to include x=2. Just don’t see where the k-1 comes from.<p></p>
<p>Yes, that would be the more accurate constraint on $$k$$.</p>

If I wanted to define Y in terms of z instead in my proof to make it easier to explain, could I include something like &#34;for the sake of clarity in this proof, we redefine $Y$ as $\{ m\in\mathbb{N} \mid m=12z&#43;6, \text{for some } z \in \mathbb{N} \}&#34;?</p>

<p>I&#39;m a bit confused on the wording regarding the 59 shades and the 12 disjoint pairs of lipsticks. Does each of the 59 shades individually have 12 disjoint pairs of lipsticks, meaning altogether there are 59 * 12 disjoint pairs of lipsticks? Or do all 59 shades together have 12 disjoint pairs of lipsticks (but then I&#39;m not sure why we would need to know the number of shades)? And for each disjoint pair, does &#34;disjoint&#34; imply that all the variants of green and orange are unique / do not repeat across the pairs? Do the variants have any connection to the number of shades? </p>

<p>You can think of it as there are 59 lipsticks, each a different shade. Within the 59, there are 12 disjoint pairs that satisfy the criteria. </p>
<p></p>
<p>&#34;Disjoint pairs&#34; mean that if lipstick A is in one pair, then A cannot be in another pair that contributes to the 12 total pairs.</p>

<p>yes</p>
<p>So even when we are transitioning from N to Z&#43; for example, we can just write that some expression with t in it is in Z&#43; with no explanation?</p>
<p>Well not quite. The reason we can say that if $$k \in \mathbb{N}$$ then $$k+2 \in \mathbb{N}$$ is because $$\mathbb{N}$$ is closed under addition. Since in your example, we are transitioning from $$\mathbb{N}$$ to $$\mathbb{Z^+}$$, we can&#39;t quite use the same reason, because they are different sets. The good news, however, is that you can usually write an explanation within a sentence or two!</p>

<p>When disproving universal claims via counterexample, if I &#34;guessed and checked&#34; and found a counterexample out of luck/intuition, is it fine to say that I happened to find a counterexample, which disproved the claim?

(Example: the claim is that all (odd &#43; even) yields even integers. if I just try 3 &#43; 6 = 9, I have already found a counterexample. but I don&#39;t know if &#34;guessing and checking&#34; is a rigorous purpose for finding the counterexample, so should I go further and rewrite odd &#43; even with their definitions (2k &#43; 1) and (2m) and show how you always get an odd integer from 2(k &#43; m) &#43; 1, hence breaking the claim into basic parts?)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Maybe what I&#39;m really wondering is if I should reduce every claim to basic parts for every proof, or if disproving by counterexample is not strong enough.</p>
<p>A counterexample is a counterexample. You do not need to explain how you came up with it, you just need to provide it.</p>

<md>Hi all,  
  
Now that some of the exercises require mathematical expressions as answers, we need to clarify what forms of answer are acceptable.  
  
In CIS 1600, all final expressions (to questions requiring mathematical expressions as answers) should be in closed form unless explicitly stated otherwise. A closed form expression is essentially a term which can be evaluated in a fixed finite number of operations. For reference, many terms we will encounter are in closed form: $$12$$, $$x^2+1$$, $$k!$$,  $$2n$$, $$\binom{n}{k}$$, $$\sum_{i = 1}^{5} i^2$$.  
  
The most likely exceptions you will encounter are summations or products whose bounds are variables. For example, $$\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (2i - 1)$$ or $$1+3+5+⋯+(2n−1)$$ would not be considered closed form, since we have a variable bound $$n$$ (the number of terms we are adding is not fixed). However, the equivalent value $$n^2$$ is closed form (we haven’t yet proven this equality, so you can’t use this post as justification if we ask for this identity, but we will likely do so in due time). Similarly, if you have nested summations, e.g. $$\sum_{i = 1}^{100} \sum_{k = 1}^{i} k$$, we would not consider this closed form since the inner summation has variable bounds.  
  
Furthermore, if you simplify an open form expression to a closed form expression, you must prove their equivalence using only material we have learned in this course. We generally strongly advise against this as it almost always entails unnecessarily complex justification. All problems in this course can be answered without doing this.  
  
We require closed form for full credit, even if it is not explicitly asked for (we will try to include a reminder in most cases where an open form solution is viable). In general, if you’re not sure whether something is closed form, feel free to ask on Piazza (as always, if you’re worried about possibly giving away too much, you can post privately) or in office hours!

Venn diagrams will not suffice for a proof. They are good, however, for gaining initial intuition.

<p>1. <strong>Lectures/Recitations</strong>: Please come to the lectures/recitations and don&#39;t hesitate to ask/answer questions in class. If you give an answer and if it is correct then you probably understand the material and if your answer is incorrect then it&#39;s good too as it not only gives you an opportunity to understand your mistake but also you will most likely not make the mistake in a homework or an exam.  Also, understand as much as you can in class as it will save you time outside of class and this is especially important in this course due to the fast-paced nature of the course. The sooner you lose the inhibition of speaking up in class, the better it is for you as then you can speak up in other classes too and overall this will help you get more out of the lectures in your courses.<br /><br />2. <strong>Recreating/Summarizing lectures:</strong> Soon after each lecture, try to re-create/summarize the lecture (repeating the lecture as if you are teaching someone and without looking at the notes). Note that each lecture introduces one or two key concepts and assuming that you understood what was covered in class, you should not have too much trouble re-creating what was covered. While doing so, try to figure out how you would solve the questions independently and if you have a different solution which is correct then that&#39;s great as you will then know a different way to solve the problem and more importantly, since you did it on your own, you are less likely to forget it. If your solution is not correct then it will help to understand your mistakes. <br /><br />3. <strong>Collaboration</strong>:  Please remember that unless specified otherwise,  absolutely no collaboration is allowed in homeworks. Like many other things in life, in this course, you will learn by<br />doing things on your own and not by watching others do it. You may not get a perfect score in the homeworks, but you will learn from working hard on the homework problems and that will prepare you well for the exams.  Note that you are strongly encouraged to collaborate to understand a concept.  You may want to present some lecture material to your study partner(s) and let them ask you hard questions when you are presenting the lecture or say, a solution to a homework (whose deadline has passed) solution. <br /><br />4. <strong>Homeworks</strong>: Start thinking on homework questions as soon as the homework is released. Some problems may take time and it will help if you get started early. Keep mulling on the problems while doing other chores.  Ideas will come at unexpected times, but a necessary condition for that to happen is that you have to keep thinking about the problem. Help is available -- CIS 160 staff is there to help you and we are more inclined to help if we see that you have already thought about the problem.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. <strong>Typing up solutions</strong>: We strongly encourage you to type up your homework solutions soon after you think you have solved the question. It<br />happens many times that one finds mistakes when writing the solutions, so this will give you more time to fix your mistakes, if any. Also, spreading out the work of writing over a few days can save you a lot of time on the day/night before the homework is due. In short, don&#39;t leave typing the solutions until the very end.</p>
<p></p>
<p>6. <strong>History: </strong>If you are worried about how you will do in CIS 160, keep in mind that each year about 500 students complete CIS 160 successfully and eventually end up having great careers. You will too!</p>

<p>Can you explain why 4 · 26^3 is incorrect? </p>
<p>The lecture notes said the answer should be 4 x 26^3.</p>
<p>Sure. The procedure to get this answer is as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Step 1: Choose one spot to place the x</p>
<p>Step 2: Choose a letter for one of the remaining spots</p>
<p>Step 3: Choose a letter for one of the remaining spots</p>
<p>Step 4: Choose a letter for the last available spot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let&#39;s consider two <strong>distinct</strong> &#34;paths&#34; through this procedure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Suppose in step 1, I place the x in the first slot. Now, in step 2, let&#39;s suppose we are looking at the second slot, and suppose we happen to choose the letter x for that slot as well. In step 3, suppose we place a y in the third slot. And suppose in step 4, we place a z in the last slot. Then the string we have constructed is &#34;xxyz&#34;.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, suppose in step 1, I place the x in the <strong>second</strong> slot. Now, in step 2, we find an available slot and choose a letter for it. So suppose we look at the first slot and happen to choose the letter x. In step 3, suppose we place a y in the third slot. And suppose in step 4, we place a z in the last slot. Then the string we have constructed is again &#34;xxyz&#34;.<br /><br />So we see that we have constructed the same string twice by following <strong>distinct </strong>&#34;paths&#34; in the procedure. This is an indication that we have overcounted, and the answer is incorrect.</p>

I don&#39;t understand how we can assume that there are no points where multiple lines intersect. For example, if there are 6 special points, I can&#39;t draw a scenario in which it is possible to connect all the lines without having some point where multiple lines intersect.

<p>They are arranged in a way so as to not have multiple lines intersecting at the same point.

If I wanna prove A = B have to prove that A and B are subsets of each other, then if I found one case in A \subseteq B where this isn’t true, is it sufficiently proving that A ≠ B? thanks.

<p>Yes, showing $$A \nsubseteq B$$ would prove that $$A \neq B$$. Often, the easiest way to do this is to find some $$x \in A$$ such that $$x \notin B$$.</p>

<p>Hi, I was wondering how question 3 from the homework would be different if the cars were indistinguishable. I&#39;m thinking that it would be 8 choose 3, but I&#39;m not too sure. Could I please get some insight? Thank you!</p>
<p>Hi, I was wondering how question 3 from the homework would be different if the cars were indistinguishable. I&#39;m thinking that it would be 8 choose 3, but I&#39;m not too sure. Could I please get some insight? Thank you!</p>
<p>As an example, suppose three of the cars are called $$A$$, $$B$$ and $$C$$ (distinguishable), and suppose the three interests are called $$x$$, $$y$$, and $$z$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then one possible distribution of these cars would be $$A$$ to $$x$$, $$B$$ to $$y$$ and $$C$$ to $$z$$. But clearly, there are many more ways to distribute the cars.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If, however, the cars were indistinguishable, then we could all give them the same name of $$A$$. And the <span style="text-decoration:underline">only</span> way to distribute the cars now would be $$A$$ to $$x$$, $$A$$ to $$y$$ and $$A$$ to $$z$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>As a reminder, <strong>ALL</strong> eight cars must be distributed amongst his interests.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting. The way in which i was doing it I don&#39;t think all the cars were being distributed?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here&#39;s the procedure that I created for indistinguishable:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Contestant 1 gets a car: 8 possibilites</p>
<p>Contestant 2 gets a car: 8 possibilites</p>
<p>Contestant 3 gets a car: 8 possibilites</p>
<p></p>
<p>Contestant 1 gets 0 cars: 8^2 possibilites</p>
<p>Contestant 2 gets 0 cars: 8^2 possibilites</p>
<p>Contestant 3 gets 0 cars: 8^2 possibilites</p>
<p></p>
<p>Contestant 1 gets all cars: 1 possibility</p>
<p>Contestant 2 gets all cars: 1 possibility</p>
<p>Contestant 3 gets all cars: 1 possibility</p>
<p></p>
<p>So the total ways would be 8^3 - (3 x 8^2 - 3)?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot comment on the correctness of your solution/answer. However, if you have any doubts regarding the problem and/or your solution, then it would be a good idea to go to office hours to speak with a TA in person!</p>

<p>Contestant 2 gets 0 cars: 8^2 possibilites</p>
<p>Contestant 3 gets 0 cars: 8^2 possibilites</p>
<p></p>
<p>Contestant 1 gets all cars: 1 possibility</p>
<p>Contestant 2 gets all cars: 1 possibility</p>
<p>Contestant 3 gets all cars: 1 possibility</p>
<p></p>
<p>So the total ways would be 8^3 - (3 x 8^2 - 3)?</p>
<p></p>
<p>I understand that, but I was just wondering since this is a not exactly a homework problem as I have changed the conditions for the problem and created a new hypothetical scenario to clarify the difference between indistinguishable and distinguishable. No worries though, I appreciate it.</p>

Each of these sets can be empty. Then, let set S represent sets that contain silver dresses, so that S = {A, B, D, E}. Is this rigorous enough to go through the questions and do actual operations on?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s consider two similar questions:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Question 1: How many ways are there to give two <strong>distinguishable</strong> watches to two distinguishable people such that each person gets a watch.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Solution: Let $$A$$ be the first watch and $$B$$ be the second watch. Let $$X$$ be the first person and let $$Y$$ be the second person. Then we have two distributions: $$((A, X), (B, Y))$$ and $$((A, Y), (B, X)$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Question 2: How many ways are there to give two <strong>indistinguishable </strong>watches to two distinguishable people such that each person gets a watch.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Solution: Now, we <strong>cannot</strong> call our watches $$A$$ and $$B$$ because they are indistinguishable. Instead, we will call them both $$A$$. If our people are $$X$$ and $$Y$$, then we only have one distribution: $$((A, X), (A, Y))$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In a sense, &#34;distinguishable&#34; allows for more variety in our cases/distributions.</p>

<p>Is it fine if I only prove these cases or do I need to consider something like x is in set S, R, and T as well to be exhuastive?</p>

<p>In general, it is best to simply individually negate both sides and if the negation requires the inequality sign to be flipped, then do that.</p>

Then saying that &#34;$$a^2$$ and $$2b^2$$ must have the same number of prime factors&#34; is equivalent to saying &#34;$$p$$ and $$p$$ must have the same number of prime factors&#34;, which is true.</p>

<p>You can include a proof regarding products of rational numbers and irrational numbers if you think it would be beneficial to solve problem 2. The response in @387 is correct, as the statement in question was not true. However, that statement can be adjusted slightly to make it true, that that adjusted statement can be proven.</p>

<p>For my proof for Q2, I have shown that for every possible value of c, where c does not equal 0, sqrt(a) is irrational. I am trying to state that proving this for every value of c is sufficient because every possible value that sqrt(a) can take on corresponds to a value of c. I am able to show that every possible value of a corresponds to a value of c, as a must necessarily be equal to 19c^2 for some value of c. Would I just be able to state that every possible value of sqrt(a) corresponds to some value a, to then transitively show that every possible value of sqrt(a) corresponds to some value of c, and thus showing that all values of c result in sqrt(a) being irrational is sufficient to show that all values of sqrt(a) are irrational? </p>

My rationale is that if Max wants to have all the creatures in Justin&#39;s list, there is only one way to do that, plus the &#34;extra&#34; elements that he can add to his own list (the creatures in his list that aren&#39;t in Justin&#39;s list). So isn&#39;t the solutions for parts a and b the same or am I missing something? </p>
<p>In part a, the creatures in Max&#39;s list can be identical to that of Justin&#39;s list. But in part b, this cannot happen since Max must have at least one more.</p>
<p>So all the &#34;extra&#34; creatures that Max can have only needs to be accounted for in part b? </p>
<p>No. But they <strong>can </strong>be identical in part a. This suggests that you should also consider the extra creatures in part a.</p>
<p>So all the &#34;extra&#34; creatures that Max can have only needs to be accounted for in part b? </p>
<p>yeah that&#39;s fine</p>

<p>Jus-Tien can select at most $$n$$ creatures, which suggests your answer may be in terms of $$n$$. Yes, the $$n$$ creature types are all distinct.</p>
<p>Isn’t the number of creatures that Jus-tiens  has an unknown variable number? When talking about selection we are mainly concerned with Max, so wouldn’t we need another variable to account of the number of creatures that Jus-tien has?</p>
Yes, Jus-tien has an unknown amount of creatures, but you are considering ALL possible lists Jus-Tien can have. You ca. introduce a new variable if that helps you, but your answer should not be in terms of it.

<p></p>

<p>This is more related to lecture but I am confused about this phrase in the lecture notes: </p>
<p></p>
<p>&#34;In other words, we want to find the number of ways there are to choose a multiset of r elements from a multiset of n distinct elements with infinite copies of each of the n elements available&#34;</p>
<p></p>
<p>How are we choosing a multiset from another multiset? Can you provide an example if possible? Thanks. </p>
<p>A multiset is defined to be a set where elements can repeat. So if we are looking at a multiset that has repeats, and we want to select a subset of items, sometimes we would want repeats in that subset (hence, we would want to obtain a multiset).</p>
<p></p>
<p>A good example is the book example in the lecture notes, where in our 6 book selection, we will have repeats. </p>
<p>In that example I don&#39;t understand intuitevly where 6&#43;3-1 is coming from. </p>
<p>I think the best way to explain this is to consider an arrangement of sticks and crosses. So for example, let&#39;s look at **|*|***. Each &#34;section&#34; corresponds to a type of book (and there are three types of books). Each star represents a book (or rather, a count of the amount of books in the category). So the arrangement I provided says that there are 2 books of type 1, 1 book of type 2 and 3 books of type 3. A single arrangement of books can uniquely be represented by one of these strings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We need 6 &#34;crosses&#34; to represent the 6 books that we need, and we need (3-1) = 2 dividers, so that&#39;s why we have $$\binom{6 + 3 - 1}{6}$$</p>
<p>In that example I don&#39;t understand intuitevly where 6&#43;3-1 is coming from. </p>
<p>Sorry, but I am still confused about why intuitevly 8 choose 6 makes sense. We are trying to choose 6 books out of 8 of what? Why is it 8? Why are the dividers included in the total? </p>
<p>In that example I don&#39;t understand intuitevly where 6&#43;3-1 is coming from. </p>
<p>8 is the total amount of books and dividers needed. In order to uniquely describe a selection of books, you need a &#34;string&#34; similar to the one I provided **|*|***, where there are 6 crosses and 2 sticks. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Instead of thinking of the 6 as &#34;choosing 6 books&#34;, it may be helpful to think of it as you have 8 spaces (where you need to place books and dividers), and you are choosing the locations to put the books.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Notice that $$\binom{6 + 3 - 1}{6} = \binom{6 + 3 -1}{3 - 1}$$, so in a similar mindset, we could instead choose the locations for the dividers, and the books will go in the remaining spaces.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We need to include the dividers, because otherwise, we have no separation of the books, because we would be treating all books as indistinguishable.</p>
<p>In that example I don&#39;t understand intuitevly where 6&#43;3-1 is coming from. </p>
<p>Makes sense now, thank you!</p>

<p>For the statement &#34;if there is no prime number p such that p ≤ √m and p | m&#34;, can I get a clarification on what this means. If the statement is saying &#34; (if there is no prime number p such that<br />p ≤√m) and p | m&#34; then it would be the same thing as that if there is a prime number p such that p &gt; √m <strong>and </strong>p evenly divides by m. If the statement is saying that &#34;if there is no prime number p such that (p ≤ √m and p | m),&#34; would that mean there is a prime number p such that p &gt; √m <strong>or</strong> p <strong>doesn&#39;t </strong>evenly divide by m by demorgan&#39;s laws right?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you can just negate that expression and have it be logically equivalent. You should also be considering the second part of the statement &#34;... then $$m$$ must be prime&#34;</p>
<p>So would the statement &#34;if there is no prime number p such that p ≤ √m and p | m, then m must be a prime&#34; not be logically equivalent to &#34;if there is a prime number p such that p &gt; √m and p | m, then m must be a prime&#34;? I am trying to do contradiction (so I would only be changing the second part to then m must be composite) but I don&#39;t understand what the first part of the claim logically means so I am confused.</p>
<p>$$p \implies q$$ is not logically equivalent to $$\neg p \implies q$$. In general, when doing contradiction, you assume $$\neg q$$ to be true. </p>
<p></p>
<p>One way of thinking about the first part is consider you have some value $$m$$. From there, you consider every single prime $$\leq \sqrt{m}$$. If none of these primes divide $$m$$, then (this is the second part of claim), $$m$$ must be prime.</p>

<p>I am confused on what the negation of p would actually be then. If I say, &#34;if there is a prime number p such that p &gt; √m and p | m, then m must be a prime&#34; would that not be a double negative because I am saying that there is a prime number rather than there is no prime number and that the prime number is greater than sqrt m rather than less than or equal to sqrt m.</p>

<p>What is the different between saying &#34;without loss of generality&#34; and &#34;arbitrary but particular&#34;? When would we use each?</p>
<p>&#34;Without loss of generality&#34; is commonly used when making a claim for some variables. For example, I would say something like &#34;suppose $$a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$$, and without loss of generality, let $$a < b$$&#34;. And then I would do whatever math needed. In the instance that $$b < a$$, I wouldn&#39;t have to do any math because the &#34;symmetric&#34; argument is covered with &#34;Without Loss of Generality&#34;. That is to say, we can&#39;t just be throwing around WLOG whenever we want. We should only use it when the argument truly is symmetric.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#34;Arbitrary but Particular&#34; is usually used when describing an element of a set. We use this to indicate that there is &#34;nothing special&#34; about the element, and the argument for that element will hold for all elements of the set.</p>

<p>Is the notation &#34;C = C1 &#43; C2&#34; proper set notation to describe that the set C can be partitioned into two sets, C1 and C2?</p>
<p>Not quite. Something like $$C = C_1 \cup C_2$$ and $$C_1 \cap C_2 = \emptyset$$ would be more accurate</p>

<p>If $$C_1$$ and $$C_2$$ partition $$C$$, then it is true that $$|C| = |C_1| + |C_2|$$. But just saying $$|C| = |C_1| + |C_2|$$ alone does not imply that $$C_1$$ and $$C_2$$ partition $$C$$</p>

* Otherwise, the answer is some combinatorial expression that I haven't found yet but I'm pretty sure would break if $$k = 1$$.

The root cause of this is that if $$k = 1$$, the only color to choose from would be the golden block, which I don't think I can use something like stars-and-bars with.

<p>Are we expected to come up with a single answer, or can we have several cases? (eg if he only chooses 1 block, it would have to be golden from a previous Piazza post, if he chooses several blocks then something else happens, etc)</p>
<p>The exact wording of $$k$$ is “He goes to the Chen-ga store and sees there are $$k \ge 1$$ colors of blocks”.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But I saw an earlier piazza about how the golden block is inside the $$k$$ colors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So here is the post that ends it all. Is there $$k$$ colors in the set he picks or in the store? Because word for word, without much margin for interpretation, it says “in the store”, but here on piazza, it is making me think differently, even though supposedly, this seems to be obvious.</p>

<p> I made this post priv because its a little specific to my answer. So I have my answer but it splits into 3 conditions:</p>

<p>1) where if k&gt;1, then something </p>

<p>2) if r &gt; k, and k = 1, then 0 because only color is gold and theres only 1 block so cant fill a set bigger than 1 with only one element</p>
<p></p>
<p>3) if k=1 and r=1 then 1 because its just a set of 1 and only color is gold and theres 1 block so it just has to be a gold block.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Is this OK? or does my solution need to be some general equation that works no matter what I put in for k and r as long as both are &gt;= 1?</p>

<md>For quetsion 3, does it count as algebraic manipulation if we write choose notation into fraction form with factorials and then do basic fraction stuff (ie. addition, finding LCD etc.)</md>
<md>Hi there! This question is more appropriate for office hours than here, but I waited in the office hours line for two hours today, and had to leave for a meeting, so I wasn't able to get help. Since I'm pretty stuck and there's no other way to get help before the homework is due, I'm asking here. I'm very sorry if that isn't okay. 

For Q3, I'm trying to come up with the appropriate question. I can see that the right side can be used to either make a question about an m-multiset of the union of two disjoint sets of size m and n, or the number of permutations in a multiset with m of one element and n of another. However, I’m absolutely stuck on the left side. I can see that it's probably the summation of some kind of partitioned set and that it’s somewhat similar to the formula for the permutations of a multiset with infinite elements of a certain number of types, but other than that I’m lost.</md>

yeah this is a question that is hard to answer on piazza and better suited for OH. My best advice is to determine how you want to do the partition, which may be derived from any special characteristics you find about the things you count on the RHS.<div><br /></div><div>It may also be helpful to note that the bottom part of the “choose” on the LHS is m-1 instead of the m on the RHS</div>

Because the induction hypothesis says that $$k! &lt; k^k$$. So we’re substituting that in, which means we can’t use equality since the IH doesn’t have equality

<p>The way I approach combo proofs is exactly what you outlined: I look at the easier side, and formulate a counting question based off of that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The &#34;harder&#34; side often requires a bit more creativity. There&#39;s usually some sort of system involved in counting the &#34;harder&#34; side, whether that be partitions or casework. It&#39;s also nice to do a bit of pattern recognition (like if I see a $$2^n$$ on the harder side, I might be thinking about subsets).</p>

<p>This is not really pertaining to the homeworks we&#39;ve done, but if we start proving a claim by induction that is not always true (but say it is for the base case) will we be able to catch ourselves somewhere in the proof that will show us that the claim is incorrect. In the induction hypothesis we essentially assume the claim is true and then using that assumption show that the claim holds for n &#43; 1. So if we can show this and the base case is satisfied will the original claim always be true?

<p>I&#39;ve tried using induction on n for q2 starting with the IH n=k of picking coefficients on some terms x^p and x^q as (k choose p)*5^k and (k choose q)*5^k where p and q are from 1 to k to have the same remainder in division by floor(k/2). But my issue with the induction step for k&#43;1, I am limited to analyzing the coefficients on x^p and x^q that I picked for the induction hypothesis, which doesn&#39;t have to be the case. The issue is that I just have to show that such coefficients exist anywhere in the polynomial, but I feel like induction is forcing me to carry over the previous choices of the coefficients to the next step.</p>

<p>For induction hypothesis, why do we say &#34;for some k&#34; instead of say &#34;for any k&#34;?</p>
<p>great question. I think this comes down to how induction is built upon the idea of proving $$P(k) \implies P(k+1) \quad \forall k$$. Since it&#39;s hard to prove that implication for all values of k, if we show the implication to be true for an arbitrary value of $$k$$, then we don&#39;t have to worry about proving it for all $$k$$, because we would have already shown that since $$k$$ was arbitrary.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since $$k$$ is arbitrary, we say &#34;for some k&#34;, since we don&#39;t really know what $$k$$ is, but we just want it to be arbitrary.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I can&#39;t quite put my finger on why &#34;for any k&#34; may be incorrect because I think there are valid arguments on both sides (for it to be logically acceptable or not). One such argument is that &#34;for any&#34; may be an implication of strong induction, but not in an accurate way. But one could also argue that &#34;for any k&#34; can mean the same thing as &#34;for some k&#34;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Given this, my recommendation is to stick with convention and to just use &#34;for some k&#34;.</p>

<p>For Q5, do we need to prove that if a prime p divides N, but does not divide D, then if N/D is an integer, p divides N/D?</p>
You should justify this
<p>In the case of Q5, would the following argument be considered rigorous enough?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since $$q\geq1$$, $$p\mid P(p,q)$$, so $$P(p,q)=q!\cdot\tbinom{p}{q}$$ is a multiple of $$p$$. It must then be true that $$p\mid\tbinom{p}{q}$$, since the only prime factor of $$p$$ (which is $$p$$) cannot divide $$q!$$ when $$q\leq p-1$$. This is because prime $$p$$ shares no common prime factors with any integers less than $$p$$. Thus, for any prime $$p$$ and integer $$q$$ s.t. $$1\leq q\leq p-1$$, $$p\mid\tbinom{p}{q}$$.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by this. If you divide $$x$$ by $$3$$, for example, the remainder is one of $$0, 1, 2$$, so there are $$3$$ remainders possible. And if, for example, $$x = 15$$, then $$3 \neq \lceil \frac{x}{2} \rceil$$</p>

It is infinite. If choosing to look at a section helps, then go for it, but you must ensure that it generalizes for all infinite grids, not just specific grids

<p>Suppose there are only 3 sections, $$S$$, $$T$$, and $$R$$. Since there must exist a walkway between each pair of sections, one possible set of walkways is $$S \rightarrow T$$, $$T \rightarrow R$$ and $$S \rightarrow R$$. In this case, $$R$$ is a dead-end, because if you are in section $$R$$, you cannot go to any other section by following the walkways.</p>

<p>The exam is <strong>Thursday, October 13th</strong> <strong>during class time</strong>. The seating assignment is in @756.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>We will not be having a make-up midterm</strong>. If you are unable to take this midterm for health reasons and with <em>proper justification</em>, your score for Midterm I will be replaced with your Midterm II score. This should only be utilized in extenuating circumstances, and historically, students taking both exam 1 and exam 2 have had an edge over students who have had exam 2 counted towards both exams since generally students find the material tested in exam 2 significantly harder.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Topics Tested:</strong><br />The exam topics may include everything <strong>up to and including PHP and weak/strong induction</strong>. However, <strong>no probability, or graph theory will be on the exam.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Practice Materials:</strong><br />We have released practice problems and a practice exam on the course website. In previous semesters, the time-limit has been 80 minutes (this year is 90 minutes), so we highly encourage you to take the practice exam under similar time constraints to get a feel for the general pacing. Lastly, we have found that the most effective way to study for the exam using lecture, recitation, or homework material is to recreate them. This involves covering up the solution and trying to rewrite the solution. If you get stuck, slowly uncover the solution until you are able to continue with your recreated proof again. It will also be beneficial if you think about how modifications of these questions can yield different proofs or can be counted differently, for example how might the solution differ if elements were distinguishable/indistinguishable?</p>

<p>This may be beyond the scope of this class but I was curious if BFS/DFS was the only way to check if a graph is connected or if there are other algos to check and see if a graph is connected.</p>

<p>this is beyond the scope of this class. There are other ways of checking connectivity, but may be worse in terms of time efficiency. Stay tuned for CIS1210 where you&#39;ll cover graph connectivity in more depth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That being said, you should not be using BFS/DFS in this course, as it would require a proof before using it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not asking whether my answer is correct or not.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Given a graph with $$n$$ vertices with the degree of every vertex being distinct. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I know minimum degree of any vertex is $$0$$ and maximum degree of any vertex is $$n-1$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This yields a total of $$n-1-0+1 = n$$ distinct degrees inclusive which matches up with our $$n$$ vertices.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Assume all of the above is logically valid.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Would I have to prove that the degrees of the n vertices are : {0,1,2,3, ... n-1} or is that implied by above?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Can we assume that F_{k - 1} is less than or equal to F_k?</p>
<p>Just to clarify, is it possible for us to get full credit for Q1 on HW 6T if we don&#39;t use strong induction and use weak induction instead?</p>
<p>But in @876, it was said that weak induction would be fine. Just wondering whether this means that it is possible to solve the question completely correctly using weak induction, or something else.</p>
<p>Ok, so just to clarify, when you say feel free to solve if either way, it means that it is possible get the question completely correctly using weak induction?</p>
<p>Do we need to prove that (3/4) (2^(k&#43;1))  &lt; 2^(k&#43;1)</p>
<p>If I did base cases for n = 2, 3 and 4, can my Induction Hypothesis be 4 &lt; j &lt; k or do I need to do it from 2 &lt; j &lt; k</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t related to the homework really, but I was wondering for a proof by contradiction, should I reach a contradiction such as 0=1, or is it valid that I reach a conclusion that contradicts the assumption I made. </p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, let&#39;s say I am trying to prove x&lt;=y&#43;z. if I assumed for contradiction that x &gt; y&#43;z, would I have to get a contradiction like 0&gt;1 or is it also valid that I reach x &lt;= y&#43;z which contradicts the assumption I initially made. I know it seems like in this case I could have just proven x &lt;= y&#43;z directly, but for some of the questions I have seen in past hwks, it is easier to assume for contradiction to reach x &lt;= y&#43;z. </p>
<p>Say you wanted to prove a proposition $$P(n)$$ in the range [LRange, URange]. Are these the proper ranges for $$n, k, j$$?</p>
<p>$$n$$ is between [LRange, URange].<br />$$k$$ is between [HighestBaseCase, URange]<br />$$j$$ is between [LRange, k]</p>
<p></p>
<p>Can $$k$$ be [LRange, URange]? Can $$j$$ be [HighestBaseCase, k]?</p>
<p></p>
<p>If we know that a&lt;c and b&lt;d, can we say that a&#43;b&lt;c&#43;d or do we have to prove this?</p>
<p>Just to clarify, if let&#39;s say we are doing induction on n, and n &gt; 10 in the problem. In the base case, we proved n = 11 is true, and for the induction hypothesis, we assume n = k to be true. For the induction step, would we say let k be arb but particular integer, k &gt; 11 OR would we still say k &gt; 10? Does this change if it is a strong induction proof?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Few questions about things we have to prove:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1) Can we assume that the sum of nonnegative integers is a nonnegative integer?</p>
<p></p>
<p>2) Can we assume that if x &#43; y = k, and x and y are greater than or equal to 1, that x and y are both less than k?</p>
<p></p>
<p>3) Can we assume that if k is greater than or equal to 4, k can be expressed as x &#43;y where x and y are both integers greater than or equal to 2?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Are we allowed to use proofs by contradiction in both our base case and induction steps to prove something is true for all n greater than some positive integer k, or should we stick to direct proofs within induction?</p>
<p>General question about strong induction: When you want to prove that the claim is true $$n \geq x$$, for instance, would the strong induction hypothesis be the claim is true for $$x \leq j \leq k$$, for some $$k \geq x$$?</p>
<p></p>
<p>If so, for HW 5t solutions question 3, we want to prove that the claim is true for $$n \geq 0$$, but the induction hypothesis was that the claim is true for $$0 \leq j \leq k$$, where $$k$$ is an arbitrary positive integer. Shouldn&#39;t $$k \geq 0$$ here?</p>
<p>Ok. so in general, we can assume that in the induction hypothesis, k is greater or equal to our greatest base case &#43; 1, in general?</p>
<p>Ok got it. So then lowest base case \leq j \leq k?</p>
<p>Will there be homework on the weekend after the midterm?</p>
<p>On tests and homeworks, will we ever be penalized for having extra base cases?</p>

<p>For problems 2 and 3, if we present a valid proof using strong induction, should points necessarily be taken off simply because we didn&#39;t follow the weak induction proofs in the answer key?</p>
<p>Thank you for the advice, I&#39;ll be sure to discuss this with a TA during office hours.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As for the lack of justification in problem 2, I believe the answer key solution also assumes that inverting the colors across the line would yield a valid coloring, without much justification.</p>
<p>Sure, I would like to see an example.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I also noted in my solution, however, that there is a one-to-one pairing between regions across the line, and that the colors of neighboring regions along the line must alternate in a valid coloring. Would this count as sufficient justification?</p>

<p>Basically the issue arises from Steps 1 and 2.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In step 1, we can say that there are five options for the fourth digit (namely 0, 2, 4, 6, 8). But after that, we can&#39;t quite say that for step 2, in choosing the first digit, there are only 8 options. This is because, if the digit we chose in step 1 is 0, then we actually have 9 options for the first digit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since the amount of ways to perform a step is not constant based on previous steps, we would be unable to perform the multiplication rule following the same procedure outlined in Attempt 3.</p>
<p>To find the total number of even numbers with distinct digits, does it make sense to find the total number of distinct digits (odd or even) and then divide by 2?</p>
<p>Not quite, because that would be implying that the total number of even numbers with distinct digits is the same as the total number of odd numbers with distinct digits, and using the logic I provided above, it doesn&#39;t seem like these two values should be equal. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Instead, you could modify that approach by counting complementarily!</p>
<p>For finding the total number of even numbers w/distinct digits, would it be accurate to consider two cases where 0 is the last number and 0 is not the last number? And then just use the Sum Rule and add them together?</p>
Yeah that works

<p>Step n: Determine the fate of object n</p>

<p></p>
<p>By MR, the total number of ways would be k^n.</p>

<p>On Lec 3T where we prove that the sqrt of 2 is irrational using the prime factorization method, why is S(a^2) even the contradiction? the notes say it is because the prime factorization of a positive integer must be unique. But I&#39;m not clear on how S(a^2) being even tells us this. Could you please explain?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you! </p>
<p>Is it: Can be represented as a/b, where a is an int, and b is a non-zero int. Do they need to have no common factors? I know we used this definition sometimes with the fact that they have common factors, and sometimes without that fact.</p>
<p>Is it: Can be represented as a/b, where a is an int, and b is a non-zero int. Do they need to have no common factors? I know we used this definition sometimes with the fact that they have common factors, and sometimes without that fact.</p>
<p>Yeah, the definition is that if $$x \in \mathbb{Q}$$, then $$\exists a \in \mathbb{Z}$$ and $$\exists b \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{0\}$$ such that $$x = \frac{a}{b}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The definition does not require $$a$$ and $$b$$ to share no common factors, though we often include this constraint in our proofs for simplicity of the proof. </p>
<p>So for the proof of if sqrt(2) is irrational, we placed that constraint that a and b have not common factors to reach the contradiction faster / with less explaining?</p>
<p>Not necessarily for &#34;less explaining&#34;, but more so because that was actually the thing we contradicted. So you might be asking yourself, &#34;when should I add this &#39;constraint&#39;&#34;, and my answer to that would probably be most of the time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is because even though the definition with and without the constraint define the same term, without the constraint of $$a$$ and $$b$$ sharing no common factors, there are an infinite amount of choices for $$a$$ and $$b$$. Whereas, if we introduce the idea of $$a$$ and $$b$$ sharing no common factors, then there is only one such pair. </p>

<p>yeah I think it&#39;s kind of hard to incorporate permuting multisets in this, because when we do those permutations, we have very few constraints. In this problem, we introduce a lot of constraints, and while it may be possible to incorporate these constraints by modifying how we permute the multisets, it gets (arguably) equally tedious.</p>

Would the distinguishable objects be the sticks and the indistinguishable objects be the crosses?<img src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkedd9r8n6wb3dq%2F6967957097280c2644fd96ea52f47e2b33365d5b0e624f4de86e43b56495a06d%2FScreen_Shot_2022-10-07_at_8.42.40_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2022-10-07_at_8.42.40_PM.pngNaN" /></p>
<p>I will be hosting virtual OH on OHQ starting 10:30AM today!</p>
<p>I noticed in the solutions to HW6T Question 1, there were 3 base cases. Isn&#39;t the third base case (n=4) unnecessary so long as we change the bounds of k to k&gt;=3? </p>
<p></p>
<p>Would&#39;nt just one base case $$n=2$$ suffice?</p>
<p>Do we need to state the bounds for any variables in the induction step of the proof or are all the bounds defined in the induction hypothesis?</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the exam, would we be expected to provide a stronger claim in order to prove by induction for a claim that can&#39;t be proved as is (like the tile question in class)? </p>
<p>Similarly, would it possible for there to be bogus claims and instead of proving the claim, we would need to say the claim is false (like the sheep question)? Or would all &#34;prove ___&#34; questions have valid claims?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>In the Binomial Theorem, the notes say that a and b must be real numbers. With the 2^n example, I used (2 &#43; 0)^n and expanded using the binomial theorem. However, I didn&#39;t get the same answer as the lecture notes. Is that a fault in my calculation or should this work? </p>

<p></p>
<p>you can still use $$(2 + 0)^n$$, but you will arrive at something different than $$\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}$$, because when we did $$(1 + 1)^n$$, we were able to simplify nicely using the fact that $$1^m = 1$$ for any $$m$$, but we do not have that leverage when we do $$(2+0)^n$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>tldr: yeah it works, but it just gives you different information</p>
<p>But if we do (2 &#43; 0)^n, we basically prove that 2^n = 0, which proves the claim false?</p>
<p>not quite. You get the following:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$(2+0)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} 2^{n-k}0^k = \binom{n}{0} 2^{n-0}0^0 + \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k} 2^{n-k}0^k = 1 \cdot 2^n \cdot 1 + 0 = 2^n$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>so you really just prove that $$2^n = 2^n$$ which, admittedly, isn&#39;t very exciting :(</p>

<p>The total number of possible subsequences is indeed $$\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$, but we only chose to look at a subset of them so that we could proceed with the later steps of the problem (i.e. generating a new subsequence from two of our $$n$$ subsequences).</p>

<p>the first step is just arbitrary selecting the three positions where these three lovely humans will be placed. The second step handles ordering them by abiding to the constraints. </p>
<p></p>
<p>So the first step of just choosing <em>where</em> they could appear (ignoring who goes in which spot) can be done in $$\binom{11}{3}$$ ways.</p>
<p>oh ok so how does the times 2 account for the ordering rather would be a better question</p>
<p>Either the relative ordering goes Katie, Stephanie, Nishita, or it is Stephanie, Katie, Nishita.</p>
<p>oh ok so how does the times 2 account for the ordering rather would be a better question</p>
<p>but in the first step the 11 choose 3 is choosing where just appear no matter which spot but we cant have nishita be placed in front of either one of them so why must it not be like subtracting some choices</p>
<p>oh ok so how does the times 2 account for the ordering rather would be a better question</p>
<p>11 choose 3 is just choosing the spots that we are going to place the people. We haven&#39;t yet arranged them in any order in the first step.</p>

<p>Since the question is asking us to show existence, providing a true example would qualify as showing existence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We break it up into two cases because we don&#39;t really know whether $$\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$$ is rational or irrational. If it&#39;s rational, then great. But if not, then we can use this value to provide a different $$x$$ and $$y$$ where $$x^y$$ is rational.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In essence, we are &#39;pretending&#39; that we don&#39;t know whether or not $$\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$$ is rational, but regardless of its status, we can use it as is, or use it to create new values.</p>

<p>This is not quite a proof for the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic because that theorem also mentions that the prime factorization is unique. That being said, strong induction is not needed for this proof. In fact, one can avoid induction completely by mentioning how the claim is just a corollary of the FTA, but for the purpose of example, we did a proof by strong induction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Also using FTA in the IS doesn&#39;t really make it a weak induction proof because it&#39;s not really getting reduced to the $$k$$ case (where you would use your weak IH).</p>

For this question, instead of using induction can we just use basic arithmetic to telescope the answer? Since the product is $$s_n = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{2}{3}\times … \times\frac{n-2}{n-1}\times \frac{n-1}{n}$$, we can just cancel out all the numbers except 1 and $n$, so we would immediately get $$\frac{1}{n}$$.</md>

<p>Q5: Prove that between any two distinct rational numbers, there exist infinitely many rational numbers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The solution uses contradiction to prove this, but wondering if the following direct proof works as well:</p>
<p>Let x and y be the 2 distinct rational numbers</p>
<p></p>
<p>x = a/b, y = c/d, where b and d are not 0. WLOG suppose x &lt; y</p>
<p></p>
<p>a/b &lt; c/d</p>
<p></p>
<p>We can find a rational number between the two fractions by doing the following:</p>
<p></p>
<p>ad/bd &lt; cb/bd (multiply both sides by d and b respectively)</p>
<p></p>
<p>add one to smaller fraction on the numerator:</p>
<p></p>
<p>ad/bd &lt; (ad &#43; 1) / bd &lt; cb/bd</p>
<p></p>
<p>We know that this is true because multiplying the top and bottom by d and b respectively adds a gap between the two numbers, such that the number generated by adding 1 to the numerator is still smaller than cb/bd.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We can keep repeating this process to generate more fractions between x and y.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The answer to question 11 in M1_practice_problems  lists the contradictions for all cases. However, since we are proving the statement through proof by contradiction would just one of these cases be enough? Or do we need to show contradictions for all possible cases?</p>
<p>Case 1 : m is even and n is even. This is impossible, since m and n are relatively prime.</p>
<p>for this line in the practice problems we can ignore 2 because it says for all integers right</p>
<p>Case 1 : m is even and n is even. This is impossible, since m and n are relatively prime.</p>
<p>for this line in the practice problems we can ignore 2 because it says for all integers right</p>
<p>wait what do you mean by &#34;ignore 2&#34;</p>
<p>well i mean like 2 is prime and even but that&#39;s only like one case so we dont care about that one right</p>
<p>evenness and relatively prime are two different things. Evenness describes a single value, whereas &#34;relatively prime&#34; describes two numbers. You can have an even integer be a part of a relatively prime pair. For example $$4$$ is relatively prime to $$5$$. Also, $$6$$ is relatively prime to $$25$$, for example. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The proof is enumerating all possibilities of the parities of m and n, but we skip over this particular case because of the assumption that $$m$$ and $$n$$ are relatively prime. It is impossible for $$m$$ and $$n$$ to both be even and both be relatively prime, because if both are even, then $$2 \mid m$$ and $$2 \mid n$$, but this would go against the definition of &#34;relatively prime&#34;.</p>
<p>well i mean like 2 is prime and even but that&#39;s only like one case so we dont care about that one right</p>
<p>wait what </p>
<p>well i mean like 2 is prime and even but that&#39;s only like one case so we dont care about that one right</p>
<p>ok so 4 is relatively prime to 5 because it doesn&#39;t divide into 5 </p>
<p>well i mean like 2 is prime and even but that&#39;s only like one case so we dont care about that one right</p>
<p>ohhhhh like you are saying 2 and 2 are not relatively prime because 2 divides evenly by 2</p>
<p>well i mean like 2 is prime and even but that&#39;s only like one case so we dont care about that one right</p>
<p>but like 5 does not divide evenly by 4?</p>
<p>well i mean like 2 is prime and even but that&#39;s only like one case so we dont care about that one right</p>
<p>Remember the definition of &#34;relatively prime&#34;: $$x$$ and $$y$$ are relatively prime if and only if they share no common factors other than $$1$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So $$4$$ and $$5$$ are relatively prime, because the factors of $$4$$ are $$1, 2$$ and $$4$$, and the prime factors of $$5$$ are only $$1$$ and $$5$$. Since the only common factor of $$4$$ and $$5$$ is one, we conclude that they are relatively prime.</p>

<p>For example 2, it says &#34;A combinatorial proof of the claim was presented earlier.&#34; However, I&#39;m can&#39;t seem to find it - was it proved in a different lecture?</p>
<p>In the review session, will we be covering the practice exam/problems? Or will we just be going over the material?</p>
<p>Ok sounds good. I was more asking if we should have the practice exam and the practice problems posted to the website completed before the review session?</p>
<p>this is up to you. Some presenters may cover some of the practice problems, so if you don&#39;t want some of the problems&#39; solutions to be spoiled, you should try to do them beforehand.</p>
<p>Why do we need the n=4 base case in this problem?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Without it, k&#43;1 is greater than or equal to 4, since the induction hypothesis holds for k greater than or equal to 3. k&#43;1 can be expressed as 2 &#43; k-1, and k-1 is less than or equal to k and greater than or equal to two, which is a base case.</p>

<p>For Question 7, is it sufficient to show the procedure to create two create a partition of the string that meets these conditions, rather than proving that it is possible?</p>
<p></p>
<p>For example my solution was that in a string of n characters, we have x 0s, and thus n-x 1s, where $0 \leq x, n-x \leq n$. Thus, if the first substring is of length m and contains a 0s, we want to find where the number of 0s in the first substring equals the number of 1s in the second substring. As an equation, we get a = (n-x) - (m-a). -&gt; a = n - m - x &#43; a -&gt; m = n-x.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Is showing this procedure of creating substring sufficient (obviously written up more formally)</p>

<p>can you point out which parts of the solution are confusing so I can clarify those?</p>
<p>I&#39;m also having issues with this problem. The solution states that there are 49 bars and 3,000,000 stars so there are 3,000,049 choose 49 arrangements. Am I mistaken or shouldn&#39;t it be 3,000,049 choose 3,000,000 arrangements?</p>
Both are correct because $$\binom{3000049}{49} = \binom{3000049}{3000000}$$

<p>What&#39;s a logical explanation for why Pr[A1 intersect A2] = Pr[A1] * Pr[A2 | A1] not Pr[A1] * Pr[A2]?</p>
<p>i.e. what does the conditional do here? Thank you!</p>
<p>Also, in l7t multiplication rule example 1, the solution says Pr[L10|L20] = 1, but wouldn&#39;t it be equal to (0.8*0.4)/0.4 = 0.8 instead of 1? That would change the answer Pr[L20|L10] to 0.4. Is there a simplification in the formula i missed?  thank you!</p>

<p>I am unsure if my thinking is correct for this question.</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. Here is my understanding: there are n distinct objects. Once within a bin, these objects are indistinguisble. We get the multiset: {n_1*B_1, n_2*B_2 ...n_k*B_k}. The bins are like categories containing a bunch of indistinguisble n_i objects. We are trying to find how many ways we can order all n objects. This is simply the permutation of the multiset, so we can use the formula we derived in L3H. </p>
<p></p>
<p>2. For the formula being used in this problem--is this formula just the number of ways you can order elements of a multiset? Like if we had {a*2, b*3,c*4}, is this formula calculating the number of ways you can order a, b, and c (9!) and then dividing out the number of ways you can order the elements of type a, b, and c since they are indistinguisble (2!3!4!)? </p>
<p></p>
<p>3. What differentiates this from a sticks and crosses problem?</p>

<p>1. you should not think of the objects as &#34;indistinguishable&#34; when they are in the same bin.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. yes</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. @1007</p>
<p>As a followup:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I want to further clarify my understanding of multisets, specifically the part about the initial multiset n having infinite copies. </p>
<p></p>
<p>For Lecture 3H, Ex 6:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The multiset with infinite copies is: {infinity * 1, infinity *2 ... infinity*25} ?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then we select any 10 crosses from this mutliset. We want to know how these crosses can be re-divided into 25 categories. So we have 10 crosses and 25-1=24 bars. Once they are divided into categories, there is only one way to order them. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Is this correct?</p>
<p>yeah</p>

<p>I am very confused what step 2 is saying in the solutions for the pratice midterm in question 6. Can someone explain it in words, I am confused by all the notation? </p>
<p>Say we wanted to solve a strong induction problem where the lowest base case is x and the greatest base case is y.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Would the Induction hypothesis always be “assume the claim is true for j, where x is less than or equal to j is less than or equal to k”, for some k is greater than or equal to y?</p>
<p></p>
<p>If so, would the intuition for this be that x is the lowest case you have proved and can know to be true, and y is the greatest case you have proved, so the next case you want to prove is k&#43;1 = y&#43;1, or k=y?</p>
<p></p>
<p>If so, why does recitation 5 problem 1 and 2 assume the claim is true for some k greater or equal to 1 (the lowest base case)? Because then we would be re-proving k&#43;1 = 2, which is one of our base cases.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p></p>
<p>Below is some information about Exam 1.</p>
<p></p>
<ol><li>The exam will have 9 questions with some questions having multiple parts.</li><li>The exam is long and you will have to be quick to be able to attempt each question.</li><li>CIS 1600 staff has worked quite hard in preparing the exam and while we think that the exam is long, we also feel that there are many questions which are quite straightforward and even the most challenging questions on the exam are solvable in 10 minutes.</li><li>You are allowed to use the backside of each page, if you need more room for your answers.</li><li>The last page is for scratch work and work on that page WILL NOT be graded. <strong>Feel free to detach it at the start of the test.</strong></li><li>Please note that if you solve a question in multiple ways, you must clearly state which solution you want us to grade. Strike out the ones you don&#39;t want us to grade. If it is not clear, we will pick an arbitrary, but particular solution to grade.</li><li>As I have said multiple times in class, we try to make questions that are &#34;$$\epsilon$$-away&#34; (for a small $$\epsilon$$ :)) from what you may have seen in class, hws, and recitations. So if you are able to <strong>re-create</strong> the material done so far from lectures, hws, and recitations, you should feel well-prepared for the exam.</li><li>You must know your recitation number and names of your recitation TAs.</li><li>Sleep well tonight, wake up in time or the exam, and eat something before the exam (you will burn a lot of calories in 90 mins) :). Good luck!</li></ol>
<p>Can we assume that the sum of 2 numbers is irrational if at least one of them is irrational? If not, what explanation is necessary?</p>
<p><img src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7gcywgetsa6wn%2F3184f5523d563a06ea1f59e64d83a1f1d2f31c584910913998ceb7abf51303c8%2FScreenshot_2022-10-12_at_12.07.47_PM.png" alt="Screenshot_2022-10-12_at_12.07.47_PM.png" /></p>
<p>So to prove this, since we have already proven in class that $$\sqrt{2}$$ is irrational, all we have to say is $$\sqrt{3}\neq -\sqrt{2}$$ and we can show the sum is irrational?</p>
<p>Then how could I prove this specific case?</p>
<p>Is the binomial theorem a topic that can be tested on the midterm?</p>
<p>For this question, would it have been okay to use normal induction to prove? My first thought was using induction, but it seems like there is a much easier way. How would I know if a question can be proved straightforwardly or need induction?<img src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkedd9r8n6wb3dq%2F1ce9ceff058d5a1213dd47f0e0cf104851ccc04fa1d05f975a9a52be3e06b71b%2FScreen_Shot_2022-10-12_at_3.07.20_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2022-10-12_at_3.07.20_PM.pngNaN" /></p>
<p>Can we assume that if a prime p divides n^2 then p must divide n?</p>
<p>I know that it is trivial to say that (even x even = even) and (odd x even = even (WLOG)) so does this mean on the exam I can just say the statement..</p>
<p></p>
<p>The product of any integer and an even is even without any further explanation</p>
<p>For permutations of a multiset, should we explain the logic or can we directly use the formula <br /><br />$$\frac{n!}{n_1! ... n_k!}$$.</p>
<p>Can you explain when to use this formula vs sticks/crosses? </p>
Sticks and crosses is for counting the amount of ways to distribute indistinguishable objects into distinguishable bins.<div><br /></div><div>Permutations of a multiset is for counting the the number of distinct arrangements of a set of items with potentIal repeats.</div><div><br /></div><div>There is no “distribution” in permutations of a multiset</div>
<p>For question 1a of the practice exam:</p>
<p>Eleven TAs, including Katie, Stephanie, and Nishita, line up for movie tickets. If<br />both Katie and Stephanie are in front of (not necessarily immediately in front of)<br />Nishita, how many possible ways are there for the eleven TAs to stand in line? No<br />justification is necessary, but showing your work may help to get partial credit.</p>

<p>Would the following solution suffice, since it evaluates to the same answer as the answer key even though it&#39;s in summation notation, or would it not be acceptable?</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\sum_{i=2}^{10}\left(\binom{i}{2}\cdot 2 \cdot 8!\right) = 13305600$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>(I see that question 1 requires only a specific answer, so I guess I&#39;m asking more generally if this form is an okay answer form, not just for this specific question.)</p>

<p></p>
<p>On slide 11, I am confused how that is a valid proof since it seems to be proving the converse, not the contrapositive. </p>
<p>In our proof for contradiction for why $$\sqrt{6}$$ is irrational, (i.e. proving that $$\sqrt{6} = \frac{a}{b}$$ does not work) do we have to case out all the possible parities like in the solution, or is it feasible just to prove that a and b would both be even and therefore it is a contradiction?</p>
<p>For case 2 (there is 1 2 in the sequence), I reasoned that we had to distribute 7 letters (P, E, R, M, 1, 2, and 3) among five spots, so the answer should be P(7,5). I understand the way of getting to the answer in the solutions, but what&#39;s wrong with this approach?</p>

<p>Because P(7, 5) does not guarantee that one of the five characters chosen is a 2.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To further clarify, note that $$P(7, 5) = \binom{7}{5} \cdot 5!$$ which can be thought of as a two step procedure:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Step 1: choose the five elements</p>
<p>Step 2: permute the five elements.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But step 1 does not guarantee we choose the character 2.</p>
<p>Because P(7, 5) does not guarantee that one of the five characters chosen is a 2.</p>
<p>I wrote out the three cases, and got the same answer for the other two cases. I&#39;m saying in the case that only 1 2 is included, why wouldn&#39;t this be the answer?</p>

<p>For part a, I first calculated the permutations: 13 ways to choose the value for a four of a kind, 4*3*2*1*48 (for the last card). Then, I divided away the repeats by dividing the expression 13*4*3*2*48 by 5!, but I&#39;m getting a different answer. Why is this?</p>

<p>Can you explain why you are multiplying $$4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1$$? If it&#39;s because there are &#34;four options&#34; for the first slot, and &#34;three options&#34; for the second slot, and so on, then you should be dividing by $$4!$$ because you&#39;ve already fixed the last card to be the non-four-of-a-kind.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you are doing that multiplication because of the suits, then it is important to realize that the order of the cards within a hand doesn&#39;t matter.</p>
<p>I am multiplying 4*3*2*1 because once we have determined the value of the four-of-a-kind, there are 4 ways to choose the first card, 3 to choose the second (only three more of the target card exists within the deck), etc.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought we could get the combinations by dividing the permutations by the number of ways to order the elements chosen to get the combinations?</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this case, I found the permutations of the 5 desired elements, then divided by 5! to get rid of the effect of permutations</p>
<p>Yeah dividing is totally okay, but only if you have actually considered all permutations of the five cards. In this case, you&#39;ve fixed the last card to be the non-four-of-a-kind, so you aren&#39;t able to divide by 5! since not all permutations have been considered.</p>

<p>Hey everyone! <br /><br /></p>
<p>Congratulations on completing the first midterm! For the remainder of the course, there will be limited collaboration allowed on homeworks. <strong>Please carefully read this post and complete the Collaboration Quiz on Gradescope</strong><strong>. You are responsible for understanding what is allowed/not allowed – if you have any questions feel free to ask. </strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>If you wish, for each assignment going forward (starting with 7H), you may organize into collaboration teams of 2 or 3 current students (you can use @5 to search for teammates).</p>
<p></p>
<p>You may only be part of one team and must list all team members on your homework submission, whether or not you specifically spoke with them for each homework assignment. You may have different teams for different assignments. See examples below.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Collaboration can only consist of discussions. After you have discussed ideas with your collaborators, you must write your solutions on your own. You are not allowed to write up the solutions together. Sharing of solutions essentially as they are written in a LaTeX file, an email, a PDF, over Zoom, or elsewhere is not allowed. This includes submitting solutions that you might obtain from the web or from people not enrolled in CIS 160. The result will be penalties that may go as far as failing the course and/or being reported to the Office of Student Conduct. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Our suggestion is to discuss the problems together, but if you made any notes or worked out something with another person while you were discussing the homework, erase or destroy those notes as soon as the discussion is over. You shouldn&#39;t use those notes while writing up your answer, however tempted you may be to do so. This will force you to write up the solutions yourself and to make sure that you genuinely and fully understand them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The only materials you may reference when writing homework solutions are course materials (lecture notes, homework solutions, and recitation guides), but no other resources are allowed. This policy extends to the Internet. Posting homework questions and/or course materials to online forums such as Stack Overflow, Chegg, Course Hero, etc. is both a violation of this collaboration policy and copyright infringement on the materials authored by the course staff.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you would like to use part of a solution from a problem presented in lecture, recitation, or past homework solutions you may do so with attribution; i.e., provided you add a comment in which you make clear you copied it from these sources. It&#39;s especially important to tell us if you use our words because if multiple students do it for the same words, it looks the same as if you copied each other. Using our words with citation is fine, but copying each other is not.</p>
<p>Although this is obvious, it bears repeating: submitting solutions that you have not written by yourself is directly detrimental to your performance in the exams.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Example 1: ALLOWED</p>
<ul><li>Rajiv lists Swap and Sampath as collaborators.</li><li>Sampath lists Swap and Rajiv as collaborators.</li><li>Swap lists Rajiv and Sampath as collaborators.</li></ul>
<p>Example 2: NOT ALLOWED</p>
<ul><li>Rajiv lists Sanjeev and Sampath as collaborators.</li><li>Sanjeev lists Sampath and Swap as collaborators.</li><li>Sampath lists Swap and Rajiv as collaborators.</li><li>Swap lists Rajiv and Sanjeev as collaborators.</li></ul>
<p>Example 2 is a violation of the policy since the size of the team is 4 (which is bigger than the maximum of 3 allowed). Sanjeev would have to list Rajiv, which would give him 3 collaborators.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Example 3: NOT ALLOWED</p>
<ul><li>Rajiv lists Sanjeev as a collaborator.</li><li>Sanjeev lists Rajiv and Sampath as collaborators.</li><li>Sampath lists Sanjeev as a collaborator.</li></ul>
<p>Example 3 is a violation of the policy since Rajiv does not list Sampath. Even if Rajiv and Sampath never directly spoke to each other, they are considered part of the same &#34;team.&#34;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some examples of collaboration which are NOT permitted include:</p>
<ul><li>Discussing and/or solving homework problems with friends not enrolled in the course</li><li>Posting homework questions to the Internet</li><li>Searching for homework solutions on the Internet</li><li>Borrowing your friend&#39;s homework solutions from last year</li><li>Giving your homework solutions to a friend (this includes screen-sharing documents)</li></ul>
<p>If you are unsure of whether or not something is allowed under this policy, please don&#39;t hesitate to speak with a member of the course staff or make a private post on Piazza.</p>
<p>Any violation of the collaboration policy will be dealt with severely.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some penalties that have been given in the past are:</p>
<ul><li>A 0 on all homeworks submitted before and including the one in which a violation was found</li><li>A referral to the Office of Student Conduct (OSC)</li></ul>
<p>This policy supersedes all previous collaboration policies.</p>

<md>Is our answer for Q2 supposed to be in terms of $$n$$?</md>
<md>1. When Serena "counts exactly how many Peking Ducks are left on the table," does she only determine the total number of ducks remaining after she picked 2 ducks (ignoring type) or does she also know the number of both types of duck?

2. Is the "$$n < 9$$ remaining Peking Ducks" in the last sentence of the problem referring to the number of ducks remaining at the end of the hour (4th sentence) or the number of ducks remaining after Serena picked two? The past tense suggests the former, but just wanna confirm.</md>
<p>I feel like I would benefit from more practice beyond the lecture notes. Could you reccomend a textbook or website (if permitted under the course guidlines, of course) where I can find extra practice questions that would expose me to different variations of problems? Thank you. </p>
<p> It states in the updated collaboration policy that we should erase any notes written while working on problems with others as soon as we are done working. If another group member takes a picture of notes taken during the discussion, but I do not do so and write up the solutions entirely on my own, would I still get into trouble for violating the collaboration policy? </p>

<p>What do you mean by P(A)? If you mean powerset, then no, because it is not true that $$P(A) \cup P(B) = P(A \cup B)$$ because $$\{a, b\} \in P(A \cup B)$$ but $$\{a, b\} \notin P(A) \cup P(B)$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>If $$P(A)$$ means something else, then it depends on what that &#34;something else&#34; is, which means you may not be able to safely break it down in the way you suggested.</p>
<p>Sorry it just meant Probability of even A, I forgot to do Pr(A), apologies</p>
<p>But the probability of an event is a number, so I&#39;m not quite sure how you would do a set operation on a number.</p>
<p>Sorry it just meant Probability of even A, I forgot to do Pr(A), apologies</p>
<p>Like in regards to this: &#34;P(A ∪ B ∪ C) = P(A) &#43; P(B) &#43; P(C) - P(A ∩ B) - P(A ∩ C) - P(B ∩ C) &#43; P(A ∩ B ∩ C)&#34;</p>
<p>Sorry it just meant Probability of even A, I forgot to do Pr(A), apologies</p>
<p>I see. Then such a &#34;simplification&#34; can only occur depending on the independence of the events.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What I mean by this is that $$Pr(A \cup B \cup C) = Pr(A) + Pr(B) + Pr(C)$$ only if $$A, B, C$$ are mutually independent.</p>

<p>are we able to ask/discuss our questions with TA&#39;s over zoom through OHQ even tho office hours are in person?</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay!</p>
<p>Am I misremembering or were we told in lecture that for any probability problem we must define the sample space explicitly. Will points be taken off if it’s not there?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Also, when we’re defining large sample spaces are we allowed to use … (dot dot dot) notation cause I think it might have been said that it’s too imprecise?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Also when we are doing it must it only be numeric and symbolic or can we also describe the sample space using words?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>You should always define your sample space explicitly. Otherwise, you do risk losing points.</p>

<p>You can use ... notation so long as clarity is maintained and no ambiguity is introduced.</p>

<p>Sample spaces can be defined using words only. Numbers and symbols are also always welcomed.</p>

<p>On the first exam, I got a few points below one standard deviation below the mean (so a little below a 30 I think). I remember feeling lost on the exam, finding myself not having any idea how to go about<br />solving a problem, or solving it completely wrong. I decided to stay in the class because Rajiv assured me that if I continued to work hard, it was highly unlikely that I would fail.</p>
<p>After the first exam, I made more of an effort to come to Rajiv&#39;s office hours every week, ask for clarification every time I didn&#39;t understand something in class, and understand the homework problems as well as possible. These three things (particularly asking questions in class and in Rajiv&#39;s office hours), and staying in touch with Rajiv over email, kept me from giving up. However, I continued to struggle just as much in the second exam, getting approximately the same score<br />as the first.  </p>
<p>I think the pressure and time constraint of the 160 exams hurt my performance dramatically on the first two exams. Looking back afterwords at the problems, I realized that they were much simpler than I thought. So, before the final, I talked with my parents, and made them (and by extension myself) okay with the idea of failing. This alleviated the pressure of the exam, and led me to do much better on the final-- getting a few points above average, and passing in the course. Although 160 with Rajiv was the hardest academic experience I have ever had, it was also the most meaningful. I was pushed to redefine my self-worth to not be in terms of academic success, and I learned so much more than I thought I could.</p>
<p>So, for you, I would recommend first looking back at the exam and thinking about whether you understand the problems given unlimited time. It&#39;s okay if some still don&#39;t make sense, I remember feeling that way because I hadn&#39;t figured out how to learn in 160 at this point. I would also think about how you have been learning so far, and if there might be ways you can improve (such as the ways I mentioned above). If you feel that there are, this is a sign that you can improve your performance in the class. Additionally, I would recommend working on reducing the stress you have related to this class-- if you can get to a point where you are not worried about your performance you will have a much easier time learning and doing well on exams. </p>
<p>Is the outcome of the ducks having bread of type a on day 1 and having bread of type b on day two different from having  bread of type b on day 1 and having bread of type a on day 2?</p>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have been receiving many emails from students who are concerned about their performance in CIS 1600 exam 1. I suggest the following for most students:</p>
<p></p>
<p>You should evaluate as to why you may have got the score that you received in exam 1. Was it exam pressure, or lack of understanding of some of the material, or a combination of the two? Whatever it is, be honest to yourself and if there are holes in your understanding of the material, fix them as soon as possible as the material will only get more challenging. CIS 1600 staff will be more than happy to help you with that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The questions that you should ask yourself is why did you lose points (if you did) on Questions 1,2,3,4,5? We feel that most of these questions were straightforward, for example, Q.5 was a simpler version of NIM, which was done in the lecture. Q.8 was similar to the question from Hw 3H. </p>
<p></p>
<p>More general advice:</p>
<p>1.  A lot of grade is still open and it is not hard to bounce back from a low exam 1 grade. In the past people have got in 30s (avg being in mid 50s) and have still managed to get an &#39;A&#39;.</p>
<p>2. If you don&#39;t follow something in class, stop me and ask questions in class. The more you understand in class, the less you will have to work outside of class. If you come to class and not understand, you waste 90 minutes and then you spend more time outside of class understanding the material and hence start working on homework late and as a consequence always feel short of time.</p>
<p>3. Attend my office hours as we go over material covered in lecture multiple times.</p>
<p>4.  Re-create lecture notes soon after the lecture is over; you should not be leaving that for days before the exam. If you understood most of what is covered in class this should not take much time.</p>
<p>5. While collaboration is allowed on the rest of the homeworks this semester, it will be a huge mistake to be dependent on your partners. Collaboration can be very beneficial, if used well, but it can be very detrimental if not used the way it is intended. Our hope is that after the first half of the semester and after you have seen how CIS 1600 exams are, you will know what is the &#34;right&#34; way to collaborate. If you are unsure, ask any of the CIS 1600 staff.</p>
<p>In summary, CIS 1600 staff is there to help you. If you need something let us know, but you will have to work hard. You have just over amonth for exam 2 and about two months until the end of the semester! All the best!</p>

Is there any way I can get my 7h homework graded or at least partial credit? I know that homeworks past the deadline can&#39;t be sumbitted but I thought I would ask because I spent a very long time on the homework this week and it&#39;s frustrating that the difficulties with gradescope on chrome crashing prevented me from submitting.

<p>In the lecture notes, it says that a connected component must maximal, or not contained within any other subgraph. What does contained mean here - does this just mean that the connected component can&#39;t be a subgraph of any other subgraph in the graph?</p>

<p>For the last question about deleting a leaf, how do we know that the leaf we&#39;re deleting is not a part of any other walks besides the one its deleted from, so that the graph remains connected?</p>
<p>For the last question about deleting a leaf, how do we know that the leaf we&#39;re deleting is not a part of any other walks besides the one its deleted from, so that the graph remains connected?</p>
<p>A leaf $$v$$, which has degree 1, can only be a part of path $$P$$ if one of $$P$$&#39;s endpoints is $$v$$. If otherwise, then suppose we have a path $$P'$$ where $$v$$ is within the path, but not one of the endpoints, then $$P' = ... - u - v - w - ....$$ which would mean that $$v$$ would have two neighbors, and hence degree 2 (contradiction).</p>
<p></p>
<p>So when we remove $$v$$, the only paths we lose are those that have endpoint $$v$$. But since $$T' = T \setminus \{v\}$$ has all vertices of $$T$$ except $$v$$, all paths between non-$$v$$ vertices in $$T$$ remain in $$T'$$, so it&#39;s connected.</p>

Piazza is a Q&A platform designed to get you great answers from classmates and instructors fast. We've put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started:

<ol style="margin:0;padding:0;list-style-position:inside;"> <li style="margin:0;padding:0"><strong>Ask questions!</strong>

The best way to get answers is to ask questions! Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are).

</li><li style="margin:0;padding:0"><strong>Edit questions and answers wiki-style.</strong>

Think of Piazza as a Q&A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single <strong>students' answer</strong> that students can edit collectively (and a single <strong>instructors’ answer</strong> for instructors).

</li><li style="margin:0;padding:0"> <strong>Add a followup to comment or ask further questions.</strong>

To comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a <strong>followup discussion</strong>. Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&A above.

</li><li style="margin:0;padding:0"> <strong>Go anonymous.</strong>

Shy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously.

</li><li style="margin:0;padding:0"> <strong>Tag your posts.</strong>

It's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a “#” before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag.

</li><li style="margin:0;padding:0"> <strong>Format code and equations.</strong>

Adding a code snippet? Click the <strong>pre</strong> or <strong>tt</strong> button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text. 
Mathematical equation? Click the <strong>Fx</strong> button to access the LaTeX editor to build a nicely formatted equation.

<div><br />Further, here are some notes about joining office hours on OHQ and general etiquette we ask that you abide by:</div>
<ul><li>All questions should include the following:
<ul><li>The homework question number you are asking about</li><li>What specifically you are having trouble with</li><li>What methods you have already tried</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<div>If your question does not contain these <strong>we will skip you until it does. If the queue is long you may be removed.</strong></div>
<ul><li>Questions should not be about validating your solution (such as “I’m confused about whether my solution is right.” or “Not sure if I have the right intuition.“). <strong>TAs have been instructed not to answer questions like these. </strong>We expect that you have <strong>already worked on the problem</strong> prior to asking for help.</li><li>When the queue is sufficiently long (i.e., wait time is over 20 minutes), we will only be able to spend up to 5 minutes with each student to better ensure we help students make progress on the assignment and reduce wait times. <strong>This means that you may only be able to ask one question at a time.</strong></li></ul>

<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Welcome to CIS1600! We have just released the first homework, and it is now accessible on Canvas! Note that all future homeworks will also be released on Canvas. This first homework will be due on Wednesday, January 18 at 11:59PM Eastern Time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We ask that you write up all of your solutions in LaTeX. We will be covering some of the basics of LaTeX in recitation this week. To help get you started on the homeworks, we have provided you a template, which you should download and write your solutions into. This template can be found on Canvas. Homeworks should be uploaded to Gradescope. For more information regarding homeworks, please check the course syllabus.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We will be updating this Piazza post throughout the week with FAQ regarding this homework, so please be sure to check this post consistently.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please make sure that you read the Self-Paced Activities in the current module. They are very helpful for some of the problems.<br /><br />Please look through this FAQ, previous posts, and use the search bar to look for your question before posting a new question as per our Piazza policy.</p>

<p>My TA today said I should look at the recitation solution to see how I should write the homework solution but I can&#39;t see it yet. Is it not up? Also, some of the questions seem very obvious and I feel like the way I&#39;m proving is incorrect. Take #3 (c) for example - I don&#39;t think we went through ways to prove questions like this in class and in recitation too. If I write:</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#34;Let p be a prime number. In this case, p^2 will have p as a factor. Hence, p^2 is composite because it has a factor other than 1 and itself.&#34;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Is this a wrong way to prove this problem? I know that for even/odd problems we can use the form n = 2k&#43;1 or something similar but I am not sure if there are other methods to use when solving prime problems?</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>maybe instead of \newline, use a double backslash:</p>
<pre>
\\</pre>
<p></p>
<p>When I change that it still gives me the same error. It appears that when I type |A| = 8, I enter math mode? And somehow that interferes with my \end{enumerate}. Is there a way for me to create the cardinality bars without using |A|?</p>
<p>Is line 94 compiling and showing in your preview? Regardless, you may need to be in math mode for lines 94 and 95. So perhaps try inserting a $ before the A in line 94 and after the 8 in line 95.</p>

<p>During the first interactive session, are we going to talk about only the first module? Or, do we also have to know the material of the 2nd module?</p>
<p>I am confused - the canvas syllabus states &#34;<strong>01 - 1/17 (HW01) </strong>  Module 01 -- 1.1, sp1, 1.2, , 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, sp2, 1.7&#34;. Does this not mean that we should study the materials in the first module till next Tuesday?</p>

<p>How do we prove that a number is an integer?</p>
<p>How do we prove that a number is an integer?</p>
<p>If you&#39;re just looking at a number, say 7, you can just say that it is an integer. But if it is a more abstract quantity (such as the product/sum of other numbers/variables), then some sort of justification based on the closure of integers would suffice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, suppose I want to show that $$k = 2x + y$$ is an integer. And suppose we know that $$x$$ and $$y$$ are integers, then you could just say that $$k$$ is an integer because $$x$$ and $$y$$ are integers and the integer set is closed under addition and multiplication.</p>

<p>I saw that Question @47 it was answered that for Question 7, the problem is asking whether or not it would be possible for the last ball to end up being 1, not if it would always be 1. Does this mean that it is sufficient to prove any case where the last ball could be 1? Or is the opposite true, and we would need to defend that for any series of ball choices, the last ball would be 1?</p>
<p>Regarding the second proof shown in the video, could we have stopped after proving both r &gt; 1 and s &gt; 1 for x &gt; 1? Knowing r &gt; 1 and s &gt;1 and that n = r * s, n cannot be prime because neither r or s are 1. Is this valid? </p>

<p>1. Can we make a proof assuming the selection of balls will follow some pattern (or, at least it is possible that a pattern occurs- regardless of probability)? The question says the selection is random. However, that technically means any &#34;pattern&#34; of selection is possible. And if we are simply trying to prove something is possible to happen, then this seems valid? I struggle to see how we can make a conclusive mathematical proof through a random process without taking this liberty.</p>
<p>2. Can we prove by example? Say we prove that it is possible when the number of balls is labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (e.g. literally writing out the process on the page). Then we prove that you can get the labeling 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 from larger collections. Would that be valid? </p>

so the answer for (AxB)XC would be a tuple inside a tuple?
<p>@Val Tannen Thanks for the elaboration, but I&#39;m a bit confused by this answer, because it sort of implies that they&#39;re *not* canonically isomorphic by a unique isomorphism. The associator between (AxB)xC and Ax(BxC) is a canonical functorial isomorphism, which is both covariant in all variables and unique. If you say they&#39;re not *associative*, then you&#39;re sort of denying an equivalence invariance which feels *morally* wrong. </p>
<p>For Q7, how clearly do we need to show that there are 1011 even numbered balls and 1012 odd numbered balls? Is it enough to argue that since the count from 1-2023 is inclusive, there is one more odd numbered ball than even, and since 2023 = 1011*2 &#43; 1, we can say there are 1011 even numbered balls and 1012 odd numbered balls?</p>

<p>In short, a closed form expression is essentially a term which can be evaluated in a fixed finite number of operations. Some examples would be $$1, x^2 + 1$$ or $$2n$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Examples of expressions that are not closed form usually involve summations with non-constant bounds such as $$\sum_{i=1}^n i$$. We&#39;ll be posting a more in-depth description of what closed form is on piazza very soon. </p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now that some of the exercises require mathematical expressions as answers, we need to clarify what forms of answer are acceptable.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In CIS 1600, all final expressions (to questions requiring mathematical expressions as answers) should be in closed form unless explicitly stated otherwise. A closed form expression is essentially a term which can be evaluated in a fixed finite number of operations. For reference, many terms we will encounter are in closed form: $$12$$, $$x^2+1$$, $$k!$$,  $$2n$$, $$\binom{n}{k}$$, $$\sum_{i = 1}^{5} i^2$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The most likely exceptions you will encounter are summations or products whose bounds are variables. For example, $$\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (2i - 1)$$ or $$1+3+5+⋯+(2n−1)$$ would not be considered closed form, since we have a variable bound $$n$$ (the number of terms we are adding is not fixed). However, the equivalent value $$n^2$$ is closed form (we haven’t yet proven this equality, so you can’t use this post as justification if we ask for this identity, but we will likely do so in due time). Similarly, if you have nested summations, e.g. $$\sum_{i = 1}^{100} \sum_{k = 1}^{i} k$$, we would not consider this closed form since the inner summation has variable bounds.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Furthermore, if you simplify an open form expression to a closed form expression, you must prove their equivalence using only material we have learned in this course. We generally strongly advise against this as it almost always entails unnecessarily complex justification. All problems in this course can be answered without doing this.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We require closed form for full credit, even if it is not explicitly asked for (we will try to include a reminder in most cases where an open form solution is viable). In general, if you’re not sure whether something is closed form, feel free to ask on Piazza (as always, if you’re worried about possibly giving away too much, you can post privately) or in office hours!</p>

<p>The explanation given wasn&#39;t clear. Can someone please explain how to determine that? </p>
<p>There are more partial permutations of 2 elements out of 4 elements than there are combinations of 2 elements out of 4 elements.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One way to argue this is numerically: The amount of combinations of 2 elements out of 4 elements is $$\binom{4}{2} = 6$$. The number of partial permutations of 2 elements is $$\frac{4!}{2!} = 12$$ and we clearly see that $$12 > 6$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For a more qualitative argument, we can think of constructing a partial permutation as a two step procedure where in the first step, we select 2 of the four elements, and then in the second step, we arrange those two elements. Note that the number of ways the first step can be performed is equivalent to the number of combinations of 2 elements. And for each of those combinations, there are $$2!$$ ways to arrange the two elements within the permutation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lastly, another thing I will highlight is that the main difference between combinations and permutations is that with permutations, the order of the values matters. That is, if we had four elements $$\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$$ and we wanted to find a valid combination of 2 elements, the two elements $$\{1, 2\}$$ would suffice. However, when considering combinations, $$\{1, 2\}$$ would <strong>be the same </strong>as $$\{2, 1\}$$ (because order doesn&#39;t matter. With permutations, these would be different cases.</p>

<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p></p>
<p>We have an important update to the interactive session sign ups. If you have previously emailed us to change or add interactive sessions, please now make these changes on the SignUp Genius form. The SignUp Genius form will be open all semester, and you can edit and change your slots on the form (click edit my sign up and you can enter your email to change your sign ups I believe). The sign ups displayed on this form will be the only lists we consider. <strong>To be on the list for a specific session, you must have signed up for it before noon the day before the session, since that is when we will be sending Val the list of students attending.</strong> It is up to you to make sure you are signed up for 6 sessions with the sessions spread out (2 sessions are between 1/17 and 2/7 (inclusive), 2 are between 2/9 and 3/14 (inclusive), and 2 are between 3/16 and end of semester), and we will be checking this attendance at the end of the semester. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Here attached is the current sign ups that we have for the sessions, so please check to make sure you are signed up for 6 sessions, and if you are not, make sure to sign up, especially since it seems the form had some errors with not registering some student sign-ups.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once again, here is the link to the SignUp Genius Form: <a href="https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10C0D4EA5A82DA6FAC43-cis16001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10C0D4EA5A82DA6FAC43-cis16001</a></p>

<p>Is the logical connective for &#34;necessary&#34; &#34;if and only if (iff)&#34; or is it &#34;implies (=&gt;)&#34;? </p>
<p>Hi, I don&#39;t quite understand how to use the logical connective. If it is necessary to have eggs to bake a cake, is baking a cake implied by having eggs? And therefore, does having eggs imply baking a cake? Or am I missing something?</p>
<p>Thank you so much, this helped a lot.</p>
<md>Do I need to explicitly state "such that" ($$s.t.$$) when using set-builder notation with $$\exists$$? For instance, is it valid to rewrite the following:

as:

$$\{ x\ \vert\ \exists k \in \mathbb{N}\  x = 2k \}$$

<p>this reads as &#34;for all k in the set 1, 2, ..., 100&#34;. As a standalone statement, it doesn&#39;t really mean too much, so typically this would be followed by some other condition/fact about $$k$$</p>

<p>When disproving something, is it sufficient to follow the regular proof pattern and then just point out when something goes wrong? In other words, should we always &#34;attempt&#34; to prove something and then if something goes wrong call it disproved?

<p>no, this would not be sufficient. This is because there may be multiple ways of proving something, so just finding something wrong in one proof pattern may not cover all possible proofs. </p>
<p></p>
<p>One way of disproving is in the case where you are proving a universal property and provide a counterexample.</p>

<p>Is it appropriate/ is there a way to use summation notation to run through the elements of a set?</p>
<p>ex:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\sum_{n=z}^{S} ({2^{|z|} -1}) = ....$$</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>S is a set of sets (like a power set)</p>
<p>z is an element of S (meaning z is a set)</p>
<p>|z| is the cardinality of z</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please let me know if I can clarify this question.</p>

<p>z is an element of S (meaning z is a set)</p>
<p>|z| is the cardinality of z</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please let me know if I can clarify this question.</p>
<p>Yeah, the notation would be as follows: $$\sum_{z \in S} (2^{|z|} - 1)$$</p>
<p>Just a quick follow up.... this iterates through a set in the same way we could loop through a list in java? Like it just starts at the first element and ends at the last element???</p>
<p>No. The notation I provided <strong>does not</strong> impose an ordering on the way elements are processed. But it does process every element. The order is just arbitrary.</p>
<p>Also would the above in the initial question be considered closed form???</p>
<p>So in the context of question 8..... any if set S = $$2^n$$...... this notation would be closed form...... because n is SOME positive integer as opposed to every positive integer?</p>
<p>Also would the above in the initial question be considered closed form???</p>
<p>Sorry... I am still a bit confused based on the definition of closed form pinned in piazza.... &#34;In CIS 1600, all final expressions (to questions requiring mathematical expressions as answers) should be in closed form unless explicitly stated otherwise. A closed form expression is essentially a term which can be evaluated in a fixed finite number of operations. For reference, many terms we will encounter are in closed form: 12, x2&#43;1, k!,  2n, $$n \choose k$$,..... &#34;</p>
<p></p>
<p>..... I understand that the bound of a summation cannot be n and that this would not be closed form.... but why would the equivalent $n^2$ be considered closed form? ie: if we are doing an operation on n or defining a set using n.... would the summation be considered closed form.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ex: </p>
<p>$$\sum_{z \in S} ({2^{|z|} -1}) = ....$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>where S = $$2^n$$</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Also would the above in the initial question be considered closed form???</p>
<p>$$n^2$$ requires a fixed, finite number of operations. It always requires one operation (the operation being a single multiplication between two values). No matter the value of $$n$$, evaluating $$n^2$$ will always require one operation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The summation with a variable bound does <strong>not</strong> have a fixed number of operations, because the value of the variable changes the amount of additions we are doing, and is hence not closed form.</p>

<p>To prove that the two sets are not equal, do we only need to prove that one element of set X can not be in set Y?</p>
If X contains an element that Y does not contain, then yes, these sets would not be equal. So showing this would indeed show inequality of two sets

I understood all the mathematical computations on why x (an arbitrary element) belongs to A, but got stuck on the reasoning why by given that x ∈ A and x ∈ (A \ B) ∪ (A ∩ B),  (A \ B) ∪ (A ∩ B) ⊆ A  must be true. Why couldn&#39;t it be the other way around where A ⊆ (A \ B) ∪ (A ∩ B) ? <br /><br />Thanks in advance! </p>

Why couldn&#39;t it be the other way around where A ⊆ (A \ B) ∪ (A ∩ B) ? <br /><br />Thanks in advance! </p>
<p>Well that conclusion is being made because we are under the case of showing that $$(A \setminus B) \cup (A \cap B) \subseteq A$$. Remember, to show equality, we show inclusion in both directions. So focusing on the direction $$(A \setminus B) \cup (A \cap B) \subseteq A$$, we would want to show that for any element that appears in the left hand side, it must also appear in the right hand side. 2.sp2 argues that for any element $$x \in (A \setminus B) \cup (A \cap B)$$, we have $$x \in A$$, so we have that any element in the left hand side also appears in the right hand side (since x was arbitrary), and by definition of subset, we conclude that the left hand side is a subset of the right hand side. </p>
<p></p>
<p>We then go on to show the inclusion in the other direction. And to show that, we would go about taking an arbitrary element of $$A$$ and show that it appears in $$(A \setminus B) \cup (A \cap B)$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I think the key thing to note is the definition of subset. We have $$A \subset B$$ if and only if for every element $$a \in A$$, we also have $$a \in B$$. That&#39;s what we are doing in the set proofs; we consider an element $$a \in A$$ and then show that it must be that $$a \in B$$ and then conclude that $$A \subseteq B$$</p>

However, $$A \cup B$$ would denote the union of the two sets and we have $$A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$$.</p>

<p>Similarly, if we let $$p = \text{My name is Ishaan}$$ and $$q = \text{I am a CIS1600 TA}$$. Then $$p \vee q = \text{My name is Ishaan OR I am a CIS1600 TA}$$, but $$p \cup q$$ means nothing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The way the two relate is that if you have an element $$x \in A \cup B$$, then you could say that $$x \in A$$ OR $$x \in B$$. Written symbolically, we have $$x \in A \cup B \implies x \in A \vee x \in B$$.</p>

<p>the issue with this is both $$x$$&#39;s would refer to the same element. So I don&#39;t quite understand how $$x = x + 3y$$ could work unless $$y = 0$$. If you are thinking of doing a &#34;recursive&#34; definition, where the &#34;next&#34; element of the set depends on the prior, then this will also not work, because sets are <strong>unordered</strong> collections of elements.</p>

<p>I have currently gone to one interactive session and am signed up for 4 more, 2/02, 3/14, 4/06, and 4/13. It says on Canvas that I need two sessions between 2/9 and 3/14, however the only other session that is not full between those dates are the sessions on 3/02, which I will not be able to attend. Is there any way I could attend a different session between those dates even though they are full on sign up genius?</p>

<p>Well there is still the constraint that bin $$B_i$$ needs $$n_i$$ books. Since the books are indistinguishable, each bin $$B_i$$ can only be filled with $$n_i$$ books in exactly 1 way.</p>

Then another instance where Set A = {3, 4} and B = {1, 2}

<p>yeah unfortunately there is a difference between &#34;exclusive or&#34; and $$\lor$$. Just try to be as clear as possible when you are writing. We will assume $$\lor$$ is the logical OR, and &#34;exclusive or&#34; will always mean &#34;exclusive or&#34;.</p>
<p>The professor said he should&#39;ve told us about the distinction last class but didn&#39;t - we did not learn about the specific terminology about OR and exclusive OR. Do we still get points deducted for terminology difference that we did not learn for this assignment? I am confused.</p>
<p>you will almost assuredly not lose points for confusing OR and exclusive OR. If we have not covered exclusive OR in class, then you should not worry about it. We take this into account when grading.</p>

<md># WLOG and Arbitrary
Hi everyone! Over the course of grading, we noticed that there may be some confusion as to the meaning of the phrases "without loss of generality" and "arbitrary," which potentially changed the intended meaning of solutions from one that was correct to one that was potentially incorrect. As such, we thought it'd be good to explain these phrases so you can use them in your proofs (as both are really helpful)!

## Without Loss of Generality (WLOG)
Without loss of generality is useful when there are symmetries in a problem. Consider the following statement that we might want to prove:

>Consider $$x$$ and $$y$$, where one is even and one is odd. Show that $$x + y$$ is odd.

Without WLOG, we might write the following:

> Case 1: $$x$$ is even, $$y$$ is odd. Then $$x = 2k, y = 2l + 1$$ for some integers $$k,l$$. Then, $$x + y = 2(k + 1) + 1$$, which is odd.

> Case 2: $$x$$ is odd, $$y$$ is even. Then $$x = 2k + 1, y = 2l $$ for some integers $$k,l$$. Then, $$x + y = 2(k + 1) + 1$$, which is odd. 

Notice how we duplicated a lot of our logic! Ideally, we'd love *not* to do that. And luckily, with WLOG, we can! Since addition commutes ($$x + y$$ = $$y + x$$), both of these cases are basically the same. I could basically **switch the names of the variables** and the proof is exactly the same. Therefore, I can say *without loss of generality* that $$x$$ is even, since the other case ($$x$$ odd) I can just switch the names of the variables and the order of addition and I would have the exact same case! So **we use WLOG when we have symmetries in the problem that can help us avoid casework**.

## Arbitrary
Arbitrary is used in a different setting. To illustrate the usage of this phrase, let's consider any proposition we want to prove using a universal quantifier (i.e., $$\forall x \in \mathcal{S}, P(x)$$ for some predicate $$P(\cdot)$$ and some set $$\mathcal{S}$$). I think of these as a conversation with an adversary -- the adversary chooses some value $$x$$ to give you from the set $$\mathcal{S}$$, and your job is to show that $$P(x)$$ is true. Your job, as the prover, is to do this for every single $$x$$ that the adversary could give you. That is, you need to give some procedure, on any $$x$$, which shows $$P(x)$$. This any $$x$$ we can say is an **arbitrary** value of $$x$$. So, we might say that for any *arbitrary* value the adversary gives us, do this procedure to show that $$P(x)$$ is true.

It's important to note that once you say something specific about $$x$$, (e.g., if you have a list $$l$$ and you say $$x$$ is the first element in the list), then it's no longer an arbitrary element of the list.

<p>Hi!<br /><br />I am wondering if the order for the bags matter for question 3c. For instance, is {r} {r} {b} {i} {t}  consider equivalent to {r} {b} {r} {i} {t} or different?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks in advance! </p>

<md>If a problem involves an application of stars and bars, do we have to explain the use of stars and bars beyond the fact that we are separating $$n$$ objects into $$r$$ categories, where objects within the same category are indistinguishable?</md>

<p>I just want to clarify which of these is the meaning for disjoint that we should use in Q3c:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. The bags are differentiable and the “disjoint” part doesn’t have to do with the number of $$r$$’s in each bag. So that means $$\{r,r,r\}$$ and $$\{r,r,r\}$$ are disjoint simply because they’re two different bags</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Each bag must have a different number of $$r$$’s</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Each bag must have a different number of elements<br /><br /></p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Let a | b^2, do we need to prove that a also divides b?</p>
<p>Are the multiset elements distinguishable? If so, then is a set such as {r * 4} analogous to a set such as {r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4}?</p>
<p>a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a&#43;b)</p>
<p>In module 3.1, slide 4, it is mentioned the Diophantine equation but it says (see another segment in this module). Can we use it for problem number 4 without proving that equation? (please)</p>
<p>Do we have to prove that a natural number raised to another natural number equals a natural number</p>
<p>I searched up the term for ~P -&gt; ~Q and it says inverse it doesn&#39;t seem to be on the slides. For Q8, I am trying to write my solution that ~P -&gt; ~Q is not enough to prove that P-&gt;Q is true. Can I say that this is an inverse of P-&gt; Q?</p>
<p>I saw a post that we need to state what the stars and bars are in the problem. In this problem, I am trying to use stars as baos but isn&#39;t it wrong to say that &#34;students are bars&#34; since the bars are just something that divides the baos so that each student gets some orientation of the baos? Can we just say that the bars represent students?</p>

<p>I&#39;m looking at Recitation 3 problem 2 for Q6 - is it okay to use the wordings and logic provided? I do understand the material but it&#39;s probably well-written</p>
<p>3c)</p>
<p>So in this case, disjoint doesn&#39;t mean the intersection of all the bags is the empty set?</p>
<p></p>
<p>In other words: we are allowed to have r&#39;s in all of the bags? </p>
<p>If 2 divides p^2, can we say then 2 divides p, since 2 is prime?</p>
<p>Can we simply say that rational divided by rational is rational?</p>
<p>While proving an if-then statement, will it suffice to prove that &#39;if&#39; holding is sufficient for &#39;then&#39; to happen, or do we also have to take into account that false implies anything?</p>
<p>if a and b are relatively prime, will it suffice to say that a^n and b^n are relatively prime due to the fact that a and b do not share any factors, so nothing cancels?</p>
<p> If the claim is true, do we still need to prove if proof is valid or invalid ?</p>
<p></p>
<p> If the claim is true, do we still need to prove if proof is valid or invalid ?</p>

<p>you must state whether or not <strong>the proof</strong> is valid or not.</p>
You can just state that it’s valid

<p>For (c), can we say that it is invalid because it doesn&#39;t explicitly say that both sides of the inequality are positive?</p>
<p>We&#39;ve recently received a number of regrade requests that do not have endorsement from a TA. In order for a regrade to be considered, it must be endorsed by a TA (either during OH or after recitation) and you should specify which TA endorsed your regrade when you submit it. Unendorsed regrade requests <strong>will not</strong> be evaluated. </p>

<p>If something is not explicitly stated in the proof, does it still hold? <br /><br /></p>
<p>What I mean is that in 8C the proof does not explicitly state that where a and b are positive a &lt; b &lt;=&gt; a^2 &lt; b^2. It just assumes that this is a two sided implication since both sides are positive and starts by working from the claim to a true statement. In the case where this assumption holds, the proof would be valid, right?<br /><br />If we ignore the assumption, then a -&gt; B and B is true does not mean that a has to be true, and the proof is invalid. </p>
<p><br />So should the proof be able to make implicit assumptions? Wouldn’t that be a bad proof? <br /><br /></p>

<p>Since X is a nonempty set of natural numbers, it contains a least element z.</p>

<p>Is this a typo? should I interpret it as &#34;it contains at least one element z&#34;? Or is z just the smallest element in the set?</p>
<p>it is correct as written. So you should interpret as your second interpretation (that z is the smallest element in the set).</p>
<p>it is correct as written</p>
<p>Thank you. Is it a wrong solution if we explicitly state what z is? I feel like z can be stated as a number instead of a letter (but ofc I&#39;m not asking if it can be states as one or not)</p>

<p>Each $$S_i$$ is <strong>a set of sets, </strong>and it is true that the $$S_i$$&#39;s are pairwise disjoint with respect to one another.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is because, consider any two of these sets $$S_i$$ and $$S_j$$, for an arbitrary $$x \in S_i$$, we have $$|x| = i$$. However, we know that for any $$y \in S_j$$ we have $$|y| = j$$. So it always holds that $$x \notin S_j$$. This means that $$S_i \cap S_j = \emptyset$$ and thus are pairwise disjoint.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p></p>
<p>I used to be a lone wolf in the HW assignments, but starting yesterday, I group of 2 recruited me in to be their 3rd member.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Just to make sure I don&#39;t get myself into trouble with the collaboration policy:</p>
<p></p>
<p>(Obviously, going forward, I need to remember to put both collaborators&#39; names on my HW now.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. If someone is struggling with a problem but I know how to do it, should the general response be to tell them which slides to look at? Basically, give them a pointer but the onus is on them to understand the procedure and how to use the information we know.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. While the page says that notes should be destroyed, would it best not to write anything down at all for them? I figured if they find out the general path, they should write a note about what to do on their Overleaf, and use that note later to write up a solution in their own words. What I don&#39;t want happening, is if they rely on me spelling out the solution for them, and that leads to similarities in our solutions, and thus, I get in trouble.</p>

<p>In one sentence: Stars and bars is an <strong>application</strong> of simple combinations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For more detail, with simple combinations, such as $$\binom{n}{r}$$, we are simply considering a set of $$n$$ distinct items and determining how many ways can we choose $$r$$ of these items. Equivalently, this counts the number of subsets of size $$r$$ from our original set.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Stars and bars can be thought of as a two step procedure. We see a direct correlation between distributing indistinguishable items to distinguishable containers with an arrangement of stars and bars. So to count the number of ways to distribute, we count the number of arrangements of stars and bars. Suppose we have $$n$$ stars and $$r-1$$ bars, then our procedure would begin by choosing $$n$$ locations to put the stars. Since the remaining open slots <strong>must</strong> be filled with bars, they can only be filled in one way. So by MR, you get the familiar equation for stars and bars which is $$\binom{n + r - 1}{n}$$, or equivalently, $$\binom{n+r-1}{r-1}$$</p>

<p>Hi, I OHQ hasn&#39;t been working for me for around the last 20 mins. How can I attend the in-person office hours?

<p>Hi. OHQ appears to be broken: does anyone know why? Is that just on my end? I&#39;m currently injured, so it&#39;s really hard to get to office hours, and i&#39;d really like someone to check out a recent homework submission grade, as I think a significant amount of points were taken off for something...</p>
<md>Hi everyone! There seems to be some issues with OHQ, and hopefully it'll be back up soon. However, in the meantime office hours will continue to be held in person in Greenberg Lounge, with the queue being implemented on the whiteboard.</md>
<md>In lecture recording we have done the "element of" version of this, but do we need to prove this?

Let $$X$$ be an arbitrary set, $$\forall X$$ such that $$X \subseteq A \wedge X\subseteq B$$, $$X\subseteq A\cap B$$</md>
<p>Do we need to prove the reverse of this: if $$X \subseteq A \cap B$$, $$X \in A \wedge X \in B$$?</p>
<p>Oops, I mean $$X \subseteq A \wedge X \subseteq B$$, not $$\in$$</p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p></p>
<div>
<p>We have just released the fifth homework, and it is now accessible on Canvas! This fourth homework will be due on <strong>Wednesday, February 22th at 11:59PM</strong> Eastern Time.</p>
</div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Even though the homework will be due after the midterm, we HIGHLY encourage you to start on it early as it covers some topics that may appear on the midterm.</strong></p>

<p>In the self paced example for inverse function, I am confused about the part where we prove f is injective. How is the &#34;using definition of inverse...&#34; part proving the contrapositive? Can we say that g(f(x1)) = g(f(x2)) from f(x1) = f(x2) ?</p>
<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p></p>
<p>Recently we’ve been receiving a number of requests to accept late HW. We just wanted to reiterate that we <b>cannot</b> accept late submissions <b>under any circumstances.</b> We give 2 HW drops (~20% of the HWs) in order to account for health, tech issues, busy schedules, etc. We strongly encourage students to keep these drops in hand so that when unexpected circumstances arise you are able to take a drop without affecting your grade. As for technical issues, it is your responsibility to submit your HW on time. If you wait until 11:50pm on Wednesday to submit your HW, you may not be able to submit on time. In the case where Gradescope (for whatever reason) is not working, you can email a pdf of your submission to <a target="_blank" href="mailto:cis1600@seas.upenn.edu" rel="noopener noreferrer">cis1600@seas.upenn.edu</a> <b>before</b> the HW deadline.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you have a longer term health issue that may prevent you from submitting multiple HWs, please reach out to us and we can try to find a solution. We are unable to give extensions for one-off illnesses, as we need to release solutions for the entire class to review from.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As always, feel free to reach out to us if you have any concerns – but know that we have limited flexibility when it comes to accepting late HW (and that you should plan accordingly). In a class of 250 students, this is critical to ensure fairness across the class.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Best of luck as you begin studying for Midterm One,<br />CIS1600 Staff</p>

<p>Hello, I did not realize that interactive sessions needed to be distributed through 3 periods. Is there any way I can fix this?</p>
<p><img src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkedxgblvppr1vj%2Fc1bef884fcdcafad22d06207c05e9865f995d2a8acc28f06396bdd505e4aca6c%2Fimage.png" alt="image.pngNaN" width="568" height="313" /></p>

<p>I am still confused about logical statements. Here, if we take the contrapositive, why is the the latter half &#34;the total number of objects is not equal to r&#34;? If we negate &#34;r objects are placed into n boxes&#34;, isn&#39;t it &#34;r objects are not placed into n boxes&#34;? How do we know that the number of objects is not equal to r?</p>
<p></p>

<p>Also, I am confused about how the above is the negation of &#34;Every sequence of n^2&#43;1 distinct integers must contain a monotone subsequence of length n&#43;1&#34;. I guess negating long statements that are not explicitly stated in succinct notations is confusing. How can I improve on understanding this?</p>
<p>Hello, </p>
<p>About a week ago I posted on Piazza about an issue I was having with SignUp Genius. I explained that I had registered for two sessions but my name ended up not appearing in the first of those. So I asked you to manually help me register for the sessions on the 3rd and 7th of February so I could meet the attendance requirements, which you did.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The session on the 3rd went smoothly. However, this Tuesday (7th of February) my name was again not on the list. Despite that I volunteered to speak out and Val wrote my name on the list he manages on the ipad. He told me to write you an email/post explaining this so that you could count my attendance for the lecture. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you for your help,</p>
<p>Diego Narvaez </p>
<p>Based on the course website, it seems that the collaboration policy applies mostly to the homework. But for non-homework matters, is &#34;collaboration&#34; a lot less restrictive?</p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, can I talk to my group members about the practice questions recently posted, or for the upcoming midterm: what traps to look out for, what type of strategies that should come to mind on certain problems, etc etc?</p>
<p>How do we get to 2k &#43; 1 &lt;= 2^k ? Shouldn&#39;t the LHS be k^2 &#43; 2k &#43; 1, why did we get rid of the k^2?</p>

<p>Hi, just wanted to ask a clarifying question. When it says prove that there is a way where they have the same average, does giving 1 example where they have the same average suffice?</p>
<p>I got very confused by q1&#39;s wording. What are we trying to prove exactly? </p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was reviewing my HW 1, and I was wondering: </p>
<p></p>
<p>Why do we need to state that p &gt; 1 for HW 1 Q3.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Even if p was negative, it would still be a factor of p^2 that is not itself or 1. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>So sorry if this is a bad question; I saw in @518 that the midterm will focus on Modules 1-5, but I was wondering if it will still include some principles of Module 6 we are learning, as I know we have had class/recitation on induction, and that it was noted that some HW05 concepts will be included. </p>

<p>Since induction is in module 6, it will not appear on the midterm. But topics such as PIE/PHP that may occur on HW5 are still fair game for the midterm because they were in module 5</p>
<p>Will derangements be on the midterm then?</p>
<p>derangements are in module 5, so yes, they are fair game for the midterm.</p>

<p>The condition says that &#34;each quarter back must be sent out at least once&#34; but the minimum number of plays is 1. (Apparently not every one of the three quarterbacks would be sent if there&#39;s only one play.) So should we only consider the first condition for n&gt;=3? </p>

<p>would we be allowed to use the derangement formula on the midterm, or would we have to prove it first?</p>
<p>I have two questions for the answer of this problem:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. The starting claim stated &#34;<code>We prove that students (WLOG) A,B,C,D can form exactly 3 study quads.&#34;</code></p>
<p>At the end of the answer, it gave a set of 4 possible groupings. How does this not contradict the proof statement?</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. How come a pairing of $$\{B,C\}$$ is possible given that the solution explicitly mentioned &#34;<code>Therefore B and C are not partners and for each&#34;</code>?</p>
<p>In 6a when we are providing an example, can we specify what k is, or does it remain arbitrary?</p>

<p>If a function is surjective, can there be TWO DIFFERENT elements in the domain that map to the same element in the co-domain?</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the example problem in 1.1 slide where we pick president, treasurer, secretary, since the steps are not independent, what would we write for the solution when multiplying each steps? Do we just state each steps and multiply them without stating we used a certain type of rule?</p>

<p>you can state the steps and multiply them, but you should cite that you are using MR.</p>
<p>I&#39;m confused - the ppt states that the steps are not independent so we cannot use MR. </p>

<p>In the first slide you provided, it is discussing the tree obtained by following the procedure in the <em>first attempt</em>. The first attempt was an incorrect procedure in the sense that MR could not be used. The second slide you provided outlines a <strong>correct </strong>procedure in which MR can be applied. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In general, the word &#34;independent&#34; may be misleading. MR can be applied when <em>the amount of ways to perform a step</em> is <strong>constant</strong> regardless of how previous steps were performed. For further reading, check out the doc in @176</p>

<p>I thought I asked this somewhere and heard they were not interchangeable.

<p>What is the boundary of the quantifier? Is it just positive integer? Or is it everything? What would be the logical representation for this , and what would the negation be?</p>

<p>g and h are examples of functions that have the domain $$B^A$$ and codomain $$2^C$$. So the domain of g and h are <strong><em>functions</em></strong> and the codomain of g and h are <strong>subsets of [1..n].</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>A good question is what is the size of the domain? And what is the size of the codomain? </p>
<p></p>
<p>The domain has size $$n^n$$ and the codomain has size $$2^n$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>To understand the function $$g$$, consider an arbitrary function $$\phi: [1..n] \rightarrow [1..n]$$. Note that $$\phi \in [1..n]^{[1..n]}$$, so it is in the domain. Note that $$\phi$$ takes as input $$x \in [1..n]$$ and outputs some $$y \in [1..n]$$. That is, $$\phi(x) = y$$ where $$x, y \in [1..n]$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When evaluating $$g(\phi)$$, we note that the mapping is defined by $$\{x | f(x) = 1\}$$ where $$x \in [1..n]$$. Therefore, the mapping is looking at all elements of $$[1..n]$$ such that when $$\phi$$ acts on that element, the output is $$1$$. These elements form a subset of $$[1..n]$$. How exciting! Let&#39;s call this subset $$A$$. That is, we have $$A \subseteq [1..n]$$ and $$\forall a \in A$$, we have $$\phi(a) = 1$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, $$g(\phi) = A$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For function $$h$$, we do something similar, but now $$h$$ maps $$\phi$$ to its range (which is also a subset of $$[1..n]$$). </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>For the last part of the question, we are given $$f$$ as the identity function. This means, $$\forall x \in [1..n]$$ we have $$f(x) = x$$. We want to compute $$g(f)$$. This is equivalent to asking: &#34;What is the set $$A \subseteq [1..n]$$ such that $$\forall a \in A$$ we have $$f(a) = 1$$?&#34;. Well, if $$f$$ is the identity, then it must be that $$A = \{1\}$$. Therefore, $$g(f) = \{1\}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For $$h(f)$$ we ask ourselves, &#34;if $$f$$ is the identity function, what is $$Ran(f)$$?&#34;. Well, this is just $$[1..n]$$. So, we have $$h(f) = [1..n]$$</p>

<p>J is just an arbitrary subset of $$[1..n]$$. It basically narrows down which values we are focusing on (of whether or not they are in the right position) in the permutation. </p>
<p></p>
<p>For the RHS, recall that elements of $$\bigcap_{j \in J} B_j$$ will be those permutations such that the elements of $$j$$ are in the right position. So we can compute the cardinality of this via a procedure where in the first step, we fix the elements of $$J$$ in their correct position (of which there are $$k$$ elements) and then we permute the remaining elements. The first step occurs in just 1 way, and the second step occurs in $$(n-k)!$$ ways.</p>

<p>Hi everyone! <br /><br />This is just a reminder that we&#39;re hosting a review session going over the topics on the first midterm in Wu and Chen Auditorium starting now. <br /><br />Note that while there is a Zoom link on Canvas, that Zoom link is solely there to record the session, and <strong>we will not be admitting anyone from the waiting room. </strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Time</strong>: The midterm will take place <strong>8-9 pm on Thursday, Feb 16.</strong><br /><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Location</strong>: The midterm will not take place in the regular lecture hall. Instead, here are the rooms for the exam, broken down by section: <br />- Section 001 (all students) and Section 002 last names Ag-Che (inclusive): CHEM 102<br />- Section 002 last names Chi-Zhu: DRLB A1<br /><strong>3. Review Sessions</strong>: Professor Tannen will be using class time tomorrow as review for the exam. The recording of the TA-led review session from this evening should sync to Canvas shortly.</p>

<p>I was doing some practice questions I found online and one was about proving that some set operations equaled the empty set.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this class, we learned double inclusion to prove equality between two sets, but I figure you can&#39;t do that for empty sets because there is no abp element of an empty set.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So how would we approach proving this rigorously? Just show that the operations limit the scope of the set to nothing?</p>

<p>I suppose you could do the normal double inclusion method. Suppose you were asked to prove $$LHS = \emptyset$$. You could go about showing $$LHS \subseteq \emptyset$$ by considering an arbitrary element of the LHS and reach some sort of verdict based on that. And then when you show $$\emptyset \subseteq LHS$$, you would not have to consider an arbitrary element, because $$\emptyset \subseteq A$$ for any set $$A$$. So this side would just follow as fact.</p>

<p>I was wondering for 5sp1, for the proof of the claim that if f has an inverse, it is a bijection, to prove that f is injective they set f(x1) = f(x2) as usual for injectivity, however, then it seems that the example applies g to both sides, rpoducing g(f(x1)) = g(f(x2)), which of course means that x1 = x2. My confusion was whether we are allowed to apply  g to both sides, without having proved yet that the function g is bijective?</p>
<p>If u have set A union set B does it mean an element has to be in either set A or B or can it be in both?</p>

If we state that a and b are integers where both are relatively prime and a is not 0, is this an acceptable way to write?

<p>it is perfectly acceptable to write $$\sqrt{6} = \frac{a}{b}$$ where $$a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$$ and $$b \neq 0$$ and $$a, b$$ are relatively prime. </p>

<p>Just like the answer considered $$n = k+1$$ to show that $$a \geq b$$, they do a similar thing by considering when $$k = 1$$. In this case, we have $$a = 1$$ and $$b = n-1$$, so we have $$a \leq b$$. </p>

<p>Is the boxed answer valid or not? I am confused since it says the solution is incomplete.</p>
<p>When a = 1, b = n - 1 = 1, so this case is when b=a, not when a &lt; b. I don&#39;t believe there is a case where a  &lt; b. Can we just read statements like these as b=a? Or, will points be taken off because we didn&#39;t put a is less than or equal to b? And in the case where points are taken off, is there an example where a &lt; b?</p>

<p>When $$k = 1$$, we have $$a = 1$$ and $$b = n-1$$. But it is <strong>not </strong>the case that $$b = n-1 = 1$$. We can say that $$b = n - 1 \geq 1$$ because this comes from $$n \geq 2$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So for example, take $$k = 1$$ and $$n = 3$$ and we have $$a = 1$$ and $$b = 2$$ so we have a case where $$a < b$$.</p>

<p>I asked about WLOG in office hours and they said that unless we are doing symmetrical casing we shouldn&#39;t need WLOG. For example, when proving Pascal&#39;s identity nCk = (n-1)C(k-1) &#43; (n-1)Ck, the TA said we can just write &#34;say the n people are named p1, p2... pn&#34;. We consider the cases where we include p1 when picking and where we do not include p1 when picking. Do we use WLOG when naming elements in a set like this too? </p>

<p>I understand the solution in this problem, but I wonder if there was a &#34;partial anagram&#34; approach that we could use. I remember that we went over a similar problem in class but I couldn&#39;t find the recording. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Anyways, in this problem we are also kind of constructing anagrams, where we 1) identify out the possible repetition cases to avoid overcounting, then for each case we 1) include the repeated (or not) letter, 2)choose subset and 3) build anagrams, but as the kinds of letters increase and repetitions increase (for example, &#34;find the number of all possible 5-letter words using letters in mississippi&#34;), this gets rather tedious. Is there another approach?</p>

<p>When doing stars &amp; bars, we can think of an arrangement of stars and bars such as $$***|**|*$$ as an &#34;assignment&#34; of the indistinguishable items to distinguishable containers. But note that the distinguishability of the containers is determined by <strong>an implicit ordering</strong>. That is, the first container comes before the first bar, the second container comes before the second bar, etc. But also note that the <em>bars</em> in this arrangement are indistinguishable. In other words, we are using indistinguishable bars to define distinguishable containers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Suppose you have $$n$$ stars and $$r-1$$ bars. When counting the number of arrangements of stars and bars, you can think of it as a two step procedure where in the first step, you choose the locations for the bars and then in the second step, you place the stars. Notice how there is no &#34;arrangement&#34; of these stars or bars necessary since they are indistinguishable. The first step can be performed in $$\binom{n+r-1}{r-1}$$ ways, and the second step can be performed in $$1$$ way. So we get the formula for stars and bars as $$\binom{n+r-1}{r-1}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We could have equivalently counted the number of arrangements by following a different procedure where in the first step, we choose the locations for the stars and then in the second step, we place the bars. This gives us $$\binom{n+r-1}{n}$$ which is an alternate, equivalent solution.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So this kind of explains why $$\binom{n+r-1}{r-1} = \binom{n+r-1}{n}$$ and why both can be used in a stars &amp; bars setting.</p>

<p>There is a solution! And the solution ties into why this is a mathematical/theory class rather than a coding class. The solution is... creativity! Often, when stuck on one way of thinking in a proof, it is worthwhile to pursue a different trail of thought. So that&#39;s my suggestion for you. Try approaching the problem in a completely different way, but use what you have learned in your first attempt in the process!</p>

<p>I understood through lecture that ordinary induction only applies to k, while strong induction applies to k and everything less than k. But, what type of questions would require strong induction instead of ordinary induction? When would you know that in this specific instance, ordinary induction could not be applied?</p>
<p>Do we have a definition for it?</p>
<p>Since the cardinality of P needs to be less than or equal to k^2, could I just have P be equal to {1, 2, ..., k}? and F be equal to {1, 2, ..., k}? Then my function would simply be g(x) = x.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please let me know if I am making a gross misinterpretation of the question. </p>
<p>For question 6b, if P had 11 pumps and F had 5 footballs, would it be possible to have a function that satisfies the properties as there would be one football with one more pump than all the other footballs? As such, would this function not be included in the answer to 6b?</p>

<p>For Q4, I have a solution that works as follows (very brief explanation):</p>
<p></p>
<p>Choose arbitrary TA t1 out of the n possible TAs. Denote set W to be all the TA&#39;s t1 directly wins over and set L to be all the TA&#39;s t1 directly loses to. Then 2 cases:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Case 1: every element in L lost to at least 1 element in W so therefore TA t1 is supreme since either directly or indirectly beat everyone.  Done!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Case 2: there exists some TA t2 in the set L that beats every TA in the set W. From here we can restart the process considering TA t2 to be the new potential supreme TA, the set W to be the same set as before &#43; t1 &#43; any number of elements in the set L that t2 directly beats (key point is that |W| can increase from before as it only gains new elements and can not lose element). The set L will be the same as before but will lose t2 and any elements that were initially in L that t2 directly beats (key point is that |L| decreases because L can only lose elements not gain any. </p>
<p></p>
<p>From there repeat the two cases with TA t2 as the new potential supreme TA with the new set W and the new set L. Since W can only grow, and L can only lose elements then we can continue the process until Case 1 reached or |L| becomes 0 and therefore case 1 reached. </p>
<p></p>
<p>So sorry for the long explanation but hope that made sense. My question is can I use this form of proof here? Am I allowed to simply say continue the process until case 1 is reached (therefore defining a supreme TA) or |L| = 0 which also defines a supreme TA?  </p>

<p>do we still have to cite any of the parity rule of thumbs?</p>
<p>Hey everyone,<br /><br />We’ve noticed recently that there have been a significant number of last-minute recitation swaps where students are attending sections other than their assigned section. While we understand that things come up, it’s important that none of our recitation sections have too many students so that everyone has an equal opportunity to ask questions and learn in recitation.<br /><br />Moving forward, we ask that if you need to reschedule your recitation section, you email both your TA and the TA of the recitation that you are trying to attend <b>at least one day in advance</b>. Note that we reserve the right to deny the request if our recitation sections are growing too large— if you do not get confirmation from either TA that the switch is okay, you’ll need to either find a different section that isn’t full or attend your original section.<br /><br />#pin</p>

<p>Am I misunderstanding the scenario? Both Thomases, with their purple eggs, put their eggs together in one basket. Both Ethans, with their yellow eggs, put their eggs in another basket. If we pick 1 egg from the Thomases&#39; basket (all purple eggs) and 1 egg from the Ethans&#39; basket (all yellow eggs), we will never choose 2 purple eggs? But both part a and b ask about both eggs chosen being purple, so I&#39;m unsure if this is the right interpretation of the problem.</p>

<p>Are both Thomas L and Thomas Z’s eggs in the same basket? And same for the Ethans. Meaning that all the purple eggs are in the same basket and all the yellow eggs in the same basket? Also are Thomas L and Thomas Z’s eggs collectively labeled 1-1600, or each has its own set labeled 1-1600 so 3200 total?</p>

<p>you don&#39;t need to provide it in parentheses format; you just need to define $$\Omega$$ and $$\Pr$$. Note that $$\Pr$$ is a function on outcomes. As an example: suppose I was rolling a dice and looking at what side faces up.

<p>I think I heard from a TA that we cannot define a sample space as &#34;number of possible ways..&#34; of something. For example, is it right to define omega as picking 2 number out of n numbers and wrong to write the number of possible ways to pick 2 numbers out of n numbers?</p>

<p>The TA is correct. $$\Omega$$ is <strong>not</strong> a number, it is a set. So we could define $$\Omega$$ as &#34;the set of all possibilities of picking 2 numbers out of n numbers&#34;. <strong>It would be wrong </strong>to define $$\Omega$$ as &#34;the <em>number</em> of ways to pick 2 numbers out of n numbers.&#34;</p>

<p>So this is correct because it is &#34;all the possible ways&#34; and not &#34;the number of possible ways&#34;? If we state the sample space as &#34;picking 5 cards from 52 card deck&#34;, is this wrong?</p>
<p>yes to the first question. For the second question, I would say that it is technically incorrect because the wording of &#34;picking 5 cards from 52 card deck&#34; seems to describe an <em>action</em> rather than a set. </p>

<p>In this question, are we inducting on x or n? I mean, are we trying to prove &#34;for all x&#34; or &#34;for all n&#34;?</p>
<p>What does it mean by &#34;n is not in the base cases&#34;? Can I use n=0 and n=1 as the base cases for strong induction?</p>
<p>can we say this or is more proof needed?</p>
<p>We know that every other number from 1 to $2n$ is even, and the rest are odd. Thus, half the numbers in $[1..2n]$ are odd, so there are $2n / 2 = n$ odd integers and $2n - n = n$ even integers.</p>

<p>this is for personal understanding only and in no means related to required material, but can expectation be thought of as a linear operator? More exactly, $$\hat{E}:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, $$ $$\hat{E}(X) = \vec{x} \cdot \vec{p}$$, where $$p_i = Pr[X=x_i]$$ and $$x_i \in Val(X)$$</p>

<p>sort of. We can see that the canonical equation for expectation of $$\mathbb E[X] = \sum_{x \in Val(x)} x \cdot \Pr[X = x]$$ is indeed a linear function. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I wouldn&#39;t say that the domain of your provided $$\hat{E}$$ is $$\mathbb R$$ because we define a random variable to be a <strong>function</strong>. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Otherwise, sure. You&#39;ve basically described expectation as a dot product between two vectors, which is exactly what a summation of the product of two entities is. </p>

Why are we solving for when we are returning the ith pair of sock? How does this lead us to find the expected pair of socks
Why are we solving for when we are returning the ith pair of sock? How does this lead us to find the expected pair of socks
<p>The total amount of socks being returned can be thought of as a sum of a bunch of $$1$$&#39;s and $$0$$&#39;s, where a 1 indicates if the sock has been returned and a 0 otherwise. For example, suppose we put in 3 pairs of socks (we&#39;ll label these pairs A, B, and C) and only received 2 back. And further, suppose that we didn&#39;t receive pair B back. Then, it is true that we received 1 &#43; 0 &#43; 1 = 2 pairs back (1 for A and 1 for C). This is essentially what indicators are. So if we were to define an indicator for each pair of socks, and sum them all together, we would get the total amount of pairs returned.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thus, if $$S = I_1 + I_2 + ... + I_n$$, then $$\mathbb{E}[S] = \mathbb{E}[I_1 + I_2 + ... + I_n]$$. And by using Linearity of Expectation, we have this being equal to $$\mathbb{E}[I_1] + \mathbb{E}[I_2] + ... + \mathbb{E}[I_n] = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{E}[I_i]$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So our problem has been reduced to finding the expected value of an indicator, where the indicator is whether or not the $$i$$th pair is returned. By finding this value, we can easily obtain $$\mathbb{E}[S]$$ using the math above.</p>

<p>Because you are imposing an ordering on the socks. So suppose $$\{s_1, s_2\}$$ and $$\{b_1, b_2\}$$ are the pairs. Then, we consider receiving $$\{b_1, b_2\}$$ the same as receiving $$\{b_2, b_1\}$$. But these are considered to be different cases in your procedure.</p>

<p>I was wondering if an outcome of an r.v. can be considered an outcome if there is no/zero probability of it occurring?</p>
<p>I&#39;m unsure what you mean by &#34;outcome&#34; of a random variable. Remember, a random variable, say $$X$$, is defined to be a <strong>function: </strong>$$X: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb R$$. This means that for each element of your outcome space, the random variable assigns it some real number value via some function you have defined. It is possible for there to be an $$\omega \in \Omega$$ such that $$\Pr[\omega] = 0$$, but since $$\omega \in \Omega$$, $$X(\omega)$$ must have some real value assigned to it (since $$\Omega$$ is the domain of $$X$$). </p>

<p>Do we have to identify a probability space for this question? If so, do we have to identify an uniform probability space for this question?</p>
<p>in the problem there are n medicines, and theyre equally likely to be chosen -- do we have to prove the following or can we just state it?</p>
<p></p>
<p>There is uniform probability on the space, with a $\dfrac{1}{n}$ probability that a medicine is chosen.</p>
<p>... please make sure you study all the material, and especially the self-paced segment on correlated rv&#39;s.</p>
<p>For example, I may have a probability space $$(\Omega, Pr)$$ where I&#39;m rolling 2023 dice. But let&#39;s say I want to focus on the first 10 dice. Can I define $$(\omega, Pr)$$ within $$(\Omega, Pr)$$ to &#34;zoom in&#34;? Or should I say these are two separate probability spaces?</p>

<p>the short answer is &#34;probably&#34;. The long answer would require a lot more conversation about what you are intending to do by &#34;focusing&#34; on the first 10 dice rolls. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In general, I would try to avoid a &#34;sub-probability space&#34; and rather just define an event. Most ideas I can think of that involve &#34;focusing on the first 10 dice&#34; can be solved by just defining an event and giving its corresponding probability.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, I could define $$E$$ to be the event that the first 10 dice rolls are all even numbers. And this would be a perfectly fine event definition since $$E \subseteq \Omega$$. And then we could go about computing $$Pr[E]$$ in whichever way fancies us.</p>

<p>There is <strong>not</strong> an obvious analogy between Indicators/LOE and IH/Induction. If you choose to use indicator random variables in a problem, you should definitely define them.

Proving $$p \implies q$$ and $$q \implies p$$ can be thought of as doing two separate proofs. You do not need to do the same proof technique for both directions. So, for example, I could show $$p\implies q$$ by contradiction and then show $$q \implies p$$ directly

<p>Does midterm 2 module 11 or anything beyond it? I noticed that the practice questions are placed under module 10 and the practice questions have no graph questions on them, not sure if that was intentional</p>

<p>After discussion at OH, I concluded that the sample space would be N choose b. However, if non drowsy and drowsy pills are indistinguishable, how would that be the case. </p>
<p></p>
<p>For example if all our N pills were drowsy ones, and we must pick b of them, there is only 1 way to do so.</p>
<p>I know from previous posts that we always have to define a sample space in our answers. </p>
<p></p>
<p>But, do we always have to use the sample space? For example, in some questions, it is required to use the sample space to calculate a probability. But in other questions, we are given probabilities that allow us to solve the question without calculating probabilities using the sample space.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I guess my question is more so do we have to recalculate probabilities using our defined sample space and some defined event (like we did repeatedly in the last HW, |E|\|Omega|) or can we simply use probabilities defined in the questions (with proper justification of course). </p>
<p>Can we assign the probability of all outcomes except one of them to be 0 or would that not count as multiple outcomes?</p>

<p>Sure! If n=4 then there are 4 vertices and p&gt;(n-2)/2=(4-2)/2=1 so p can = 2.</p>
<p>In this case, we can imagine that there are 2 separate connected components each with 2 vertices and a rainbow connecting them</p>

Is it necessary to explicitly define any graphs we mention in our proofs, such as through something like “Consider an arbitrary graph G=(V, E)”? Or is it fine to explain graphs without explicitly defining the sets of vertices/edges and just thoroughly explaining everything?

<p>If you introduce a graph, you should be explaining what the vertex set is and what the edge set is. You do not have to give perfect set definitions, but you should explain what the vertices are in relation to the question and what the edges are in relation to the question</p>

<p>Q4: Let&#39;s say p is the statement: all n vertices and n edges are used to make the graph, and q is the statement: the resulting graph has one cycle. So Dilini finds p implies q. Now, what Darren should be saying (the converse) is q implies p. But with how it is phrased, he&#39;s basically saying &#34;Ah, but the converse is also true! p implies q!&#34;</p>

<p>In general, you should avoid using Euler-Venn Diagrams as part of your proof. Instead, you can show $$(E \setminus F) \cup (E \cap F) \cup (F\setminus E) = E \cup F$$ via set proof (consider an arbitrary element of the LHS and show that it appears in the RHS and vice versa).</p>

<p>Yes this is a valid solution. You can simplify this by first noting, from Pascal&#39;s triangle, that:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\binom{2n}{0} + \binom{2n}{1} + ... + \binom{2n}{2n} = 2^{2n}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, we see that $$\binom{2n}{0} = \binom{2n}{2n}$$, $$\binom{2n}{1} = \binom{2n}{2n-1}$$, etc. so the above simplifies to:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$(\binom{2n}{0} + \binom{2n}{2n}) + (\binom{2n}{1} + \binom{2n}{2n-1}) + ... + \binom{2n}{n} = 2^{2n}$$</p>
<p>$$2 \cdot \binom{2n}{0} + 2 \cdot \binom{2n}{1} + ... + 2 \cdot \binom{2n}{n-1} + \binom{2n}{n} = 2^{2n}$$</p>
<p>$$2 \cdot \left( \binom{2n}{0} + \binom{2n}{1} + \ldots + \binom{2n}{n-1} \right) = 2^{2n} - \binom{2n}{n}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And thus, $$\binom{2n}{0} + \binom{2n}{1} + \ldots + \binom{2n}{n-1} = \frac{2^{2n} - \binom{2n}{n}}{2}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So then your final answer would become $$\frac{\frac{2^{2n} - \binom{2n}{n}}{2}}{2^{2n}} = \frac{2^{2n} - \binom{2n}{n}}{2^{2n+1}}$$ which is the correct answer.</p>

I know that we are pigeonholing on the values of the codomain, but don&#39;t see how this guarantees f(1) = g(1)?

That is, we will have holes labeled 0, 1, and 2 (for the three possible values of the codomain, and for a function $$f$$ (which is a pigeon), it will be placed in the hole labeled $$f(1)$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By PHP, you we can conclude that there exists a hole with at least $$\lceil \frac{27}{3} \rceil = 9$$ pigeons (functions) in it. But we notice that for two functions $$f$$ and $$g$$ to be in the same hole, it must be the case that $$f(1) = g(1)$$. In other words, suppose we have two functions $$f$$ and $$g$$ that both landed in hole (WLOG) 0. Then, by construction, it MUST be that we had $$f(1) = 0$$ and $$g(1) = 0$$, so we can say that $$f(1) = g(1)$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since our hole has $$9$$ pigeons, it must be the case that the output of all of them on input $$1$$ is equal. So we take any $$9$$ of the pigeons/functions that landed in this hole.</p>
I&#39;m still confused on how you know that it is f(1) = g(1).
What are the holes and pigeons defined?
<p>The pigeons are the functions. The holes are $$0, 1, 2$$, which are the possible values of $$f(1)$$. A function $$f$$ &#34;flies&#34; into the hole of $$f(1)$$.</p>
I&#39;m still confused on how you know that it is f(1) = g(1).
What are the holes and pigeons defined?
Why is it that f(1)=g(1) if f,g, are  any 2 pigeons that flie into H?
I&#39;m still confused on how you know that it is f(1) = g(1).
What are the holes and pigeons defined?
<p>Because we said that a function goes into hole $$H$$ if $$f(1) = H$$. So if both $$f, g$$ are in $$H$$, then $$f(1) = H$$ and $$g(1) = H$$, so $$f(1) = g(1)$$.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I am confused why x not equal to 6 is not a valid way of showing that there are other outcomes other than 6. I went to office hours and Helen endorsed my request, however, I understand it is past the regrade request timeline. However, I was sick this past week with a fever so I was only able to review over my mistakes very recently. Is there still a way I can submit a request or no?</p>

<p>Based on the given recurrence relation and intuition (one cut would split the pizza into 2 pieces), I&#39;m confused about why C(1) is 1 in the recursion tree? Am I missing something?</p>
<p>The tree isn&#39;t saying that $$C(1) = 1$$, but rather that $$C(1)$$ will <em>&#34;contribute&#34; </em>or <em>&#34;add&#34;</em> 1 when we encounter it. In other words, it adds 1 to the value of the sum of the previous terms. This value comes from the recurrence relation being $$C(n) = C(n-1) + {\color{red} n}$$ where the $${\color{red} n}$$ is the &#34;addition&#34; part. This is also why the tree is called a &#34;tree of additions&#34;.</p>

<p>$$\{\omega_1, \omega_3\}$$ is defined to be equivalent to $$E$$, which is an event. Recall that an event is defined to be a subset of the outcome space. In words, we would say that &#34;E is the event that one of $$\omega_1$$ or $$\omega_3$$ occurs&#34;. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Since an event $$E \subseteq \Omega$$ (that is, $$E$$ is a sub<strong>set</strong>), we can perform set operations on it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So $$E \cap F$$ is the <strong>intersection</strong> of events $$E$$ and $$F$$, which is the outcomes that are described by both $$E$$ and $$F$$.</p>

Then it is still possible to have another HTT somewhere else in the length n sequence, which overlaps when we count HTT at that position.

<p>In general, events $$B$$ and $$C$$ are independent if $$\Pr[B \cap C] = \Pr[B] \cdot \Pr[C]$$. This <strong>does not mean that </strong>$$B \cap C = \emptyset$$ or $$\Pr[B \cap C] = 0$$. These <em>could</em> occur, but do not <em>have</em> to. </p>

<p>If we only showed $$n = 0$$, then in our IH, the value of $$k$$ would be bounded as $$k \geq 0$$. So in the induction step, we would consider $$k + 1$$, which could take on the value of $$1$$ (when $$k = 0$$). Then, we would not be able to say that $$P(k-1)$$ holds by our IH, and we would thus be stuck.</p>

<p>Because $$\mathrm{Val}(X) = \{a, b\}$$, which means that for any $$\alpha \neq a, b$$, we would have $$\Pr[X = \alpha] = 0$$. Therefore, to calculate $$\Pr[X \leq \frac{a+b}{2}]$$, we can take the following sum:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\Pr[X \leq \frac{a+b}{2}] = \sum_{\alpha \leq \frac{a+b}{2}} \Pr[X = \alpha]$$. But all of these probabilities will be $$0$$ except when $$\alpha = a$$. So the sum reduces to $$\Pr[X = a]$$.</p>

<p>No. In ordinary induction, we almost always need only one base case. This is because we only &#34;rely&#34; on one prior term. It is not wrong to have more than one base case, but from a convention/proof writing standpoint, it is better to have just one base case than multiple unnecessary base cases.</p>

<p>This is because we want to prove it for all $$n \geq 1$$ and the recurrence is defined for all $$n \geq 1$$.

Does the fact that we know only 2 lines can form an intersection show that any interior point has to be mapped to only one piece?
Does the fact that we know only 2 lines can form an intersection show that any interior point has to be mapped to only one piece?
<p>I&#39;m gonna be honest here -- I&#39;m not totally sure. My best guess is that each &#34;border&#34; point can dictate a &#34;direction&#34; (i.e. whether to look at the left or the right of the line). Then, for each interior cross point that lies on the cut formed by the border point, the piece associated with that interior point is the piece in the direction that was dictated by the border point.</p>

<p>what is the law of total probability </p>
<p>In questions with tree diagrams, if I want to get the probability of an outcome can I multiply across a branch say 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6 or do I need to justify this? If I need to justify it, do I use MR and just say they are independent or must I cite the conditional probabilities?</p>

<p>We are just doing PIE to get the parenthetical part. We have:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$|B_1 \cup ... \cup B_n| = \sum_i |B_i| - \sum_{i, j} |B_i \cap B_j| + \sum_{i, j, k} |B_i \cap B_j \cap B_k| - \ldots + \sum_{1..n} |B_1 \cap B_2 \cap ... \cap B_n|$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>Consider, for example, the third summation of $$\sum_{i, j, k} |B_i \cap B_j \cap B_k|$$. In words, for a single $$i, j, k$$, we have that $$B_i \cap B_j \cap B_k$$ being the permutations in which $$h_i$$ <strong>does </strong>appear in position $$i$$, $$h_j$$ <strong>does </strong>appear in position $$j$$, and $$h_k$$ <strong>does </strong>appear in position $$k$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To find this cardinality, we do a simple counting procedure:</p>
<p>Step 1: Place $$h_i, h_j, h_k$$ in positions $$i, j, k$$ respectively (1 way)</p>
<p>Step 2: Arrange the remaining elements ($$(n-3)!$$ ways)</p>
<p></p>
<p>So for a <strong>single </strong>$$i, j, k$$, we have $$|B_i \cap B_j \cap B_k| = (n-3)!$$. For the summation term , we have $$\sum_{i, j, k} |B_i \cap B_j \cap B_k| = \sum_{i, j, k} (n-3)!$$. The question is, how many $$i, j, k$$ triples are there? Well, there are $$\binom{n}{3} = \frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So this summation term reduces to $$\frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!} \cdot (n-3)! = \frac{n!}{3!}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can do a similar thing for all of the other summations, plug it back into the PIE equation, and factor out an $$n!$$, and you will get the desired expression.</p>

<p>Hi, I was wondering if I could get more insight into the example shown below. I&#39;m not sure why S (the sum of two fair dice) is not the same as D &#43; D if it is the same as G &#43; P, since I thought that G (the number shown by green dice), P (the number shown by purple dice), and D (the number shown by fair dice) were essentially the same random variable.

Then, if our given equation was S(k&#43;1) = 2*S(k), will we only need base case n=0 and k is greater than or equal to 0? Also, if so, then why can&#39;t we just write S(k&#43;2) = S(k&#43;1) &#43; S(k) as our given equation so then the least value of k can be 0?</p>

<p></p>
<p>Just a more general question: are there any general rules to where/how to define j and k for strong induction? Or just k for ordinary induction?</p>
<p>It seems as if this was a mistake. You should refer to the official posted solutions for an accurate solution. We should have $$0 \leq j \leq k$$ and also bound $$k \geq 1$$. We bound $$k \geq 1$$ by referring to the largest base case (which in this case, is $$1$$).</p>
<p></p>
<p>In terms of how $$j$$ and $$k$$ are defined in a range, you should always specify a lower bound for $$k$$. And it will always be the case that $$j \leq k$$ (as specified by our assumption). This is because we need to assume everything up to and including $$k$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To address your last few questions, $$k$$ should be bounded by the largest base case. We should have $$j$$ spanning in between the lower bound and the upper bound of $$k$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In ordinary induction, we simply assume the claim &#34;for $$n = k$$ where $$k \geq \alpha$$&#34; where $$\alpha$$ is the value tested in the base case. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I think the document posted in @823 would be a great reading to get more clarifications.</p>
<p>^^I bound k by 2 in homework and got points off for it. Would love for this to be clarified!</p>
<p>see above.</p>
<p>Would also love clarification on when to use j and when to use k in the induction step for strong induction! Some examples prove P(k &#43; 1) while some examples prove P(j &#43; 1), so just wondering if there&#39;s a general rule to follow for that?</p>
<p>In the induction hypothesis, you need to do a change of variables. Say, for example, a question is posed in terms of $$n$$. Then in the IH, you should be changing the variables to whatever variable you choose. We commonly choose $$k$$, but it could be anything. </p>

<p>When we change variables for strong induction, should we change the variable to j or k assuming that the bound was 0 &lt;= j &lt;= k for example?</p>

<p>If you have the bound $$0 \leq j \leq k$$, then that means you are changing the variable <strong>to k. </strong>You also are introducing a <em>separate</em> variable $$j$$ that is spanning through all values that you are assuming the claim for.</p>

<p>Gotcha; so if we are changing the variable to k in this case, then the only place that j gets used is in the definition of the bound? The actual IS would be completed proving that P(k &#43; 1), not P(j &#43; 1)?</p>

<p>yes exactly</p>
<p>Just to clarify the 0 &lt;= j &lt;= k bound addressing the initial question: the lower bound of this inequality is 0 because the base cases start at 0, correct?</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>I see that in M2EPQ2 and Q3, the answers set lower bounds for both k to be 0 ($$k\in \mathbb{N}$$). Q3 was clarified to be an error in @1231. Why was k in Q2 bound by 0 (the lowest base case)?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Regardless of the reason to above, in general, would it be correct to define lower bound for k as the highest base case?</p>
<p>Q2 should have the bound of $$k \geq 1$$.</p>

<p>You could solve this using conditional probability.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let A be the event that the 12 other cards in your hand are Ace, 2, 3, 4. Let B be the event that you drew the 4 of spades.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, $$\Pr[A | B] = \frac{\Pr[A \cap B]}{\Pr[B]} = \frac{\frac{|A \cap B|}{|\Omega|}}{\frac{|B|}{|\Omega|}} = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|B|}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To calculate $$|A \cap B|$$, we need to find the number of hands that have the 4 of spades and all the remaining cards are Aces, 2, 3, 4. Consider the counting procedure:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Step 1: Include the 4 of spades in your hand.</p>
<p>Step 2: Out of all remaining possible Aces, 2&#39;s, 3&#39;s and 4&#39;s, choose 12 cards to include in your hand.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Step 1 can be performed in 1 way. Step 2 can be performed in $$\binom{15}{12}$$ ways. So by MR, $$|A \cap B| = \binom{15}{12}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To calculate $$|B|$$, we need the number of hands that have the 4 of spades.</p>
<p>Step 1: Include the 4 of spades.</p>
<p>Step 2: Choose 12 remaining cards.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Step 1 can be performed in 1 way. Step 2, since there are 51 cards left to choose from, can be performed in $$\binom{51}{12}$$ ways.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Do we have to prove that a spanning tree T of graph G contains every cut edge in G? Since in module 13 it says if ek is not a cut edge in G, then either remove it or keep it in T. Then by that logic, if ek is a cut edge in G, then it has to be in T.</p>
<p>Do we need to prove that an edge in a cycle cannot be a cut-edge?</p>
<p>&#34;There is no sequence of wizards w, α1, α2, . . . , αk, w such that w is dueling α1 and α1 is dueling α2, ..., and αk is dueling w.&#34;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Do all a_n in the sequence have to be distinct?</p>
<p>Say that e and e&#39; have vertices u and v at the end. If both e and e&#39; have some edge between them that connects two arbitrary vertices m and n, would this edge between m and n be in the graph (T&#39; &#43; e) - e&#39;?</p>
<p>Is the statement asking if it&#39;s at most two, or is the !!11!1!! apart of the claim? I&#39;m just confused because I know this is a possible way of denoting derangements. </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p></p>
<p>I signed up for interactive session on Tuesday, April 4th, but I will now be out of town for that class. Should I un-sign up on the website and re-sign up for another day? Or is there another process that has to happen to change interactive sessions?</p>

<p>Do we need to prove that, under the conditions in the problem, &#34;If I take the undirected<br />graph G = (V, E) such that the vertices V are the landmarks around town and E are the<br />(bidirectional) roads connecting them, then every cycle in G has odd length&#34; as well as the claim “For any undirected graph G where my previous claim about cycles is true, then I know that the minimum degree in the graph must be at most two&#34;, or are we only proving the second claim is true, taking as a given that the first is true?</p>

12.3 already proved that |E| = |V| - |CC|
<p>Do we have to prove that if you remove a single edge from a cycle, the nodes are still connected</p>
<p>Can we directly say that a connected graph on n vertices is a tree if it has n−1 edges?</p>
<p>Sorry for a question unrelated to this class. I&#39;m deciding whether I should sign up for CIS 3200 Introduction to Algorithms this summer. Is it doable if I haven&#39;t taken data structure yet? </p>
<p>Can we use the definition from the recitation slide: &#34;G is a connected graph with n vertices and n − 1 edges&#34; in our proof? Or are we supposed to ignore this and basically prove this statement via proof methods? </p>

<div>In order to use @1259, I tried to prove that a graph with n vertices and n-1 edges is connected for this question, but I actually ended up with the opposite conclusion. I noticed that a graph with n vertices and n-1 edges is not necessarily connected because a graph with a cycle of length n−1 and an isolated vertex has n vertices and n−1 edges and it&#39;s not connected. In this case, I proved that Claire-y is incorrect. How can this be? Am I misunderstanding the question or missing some information?</div>

<p>Claire-y the fairy is visiting her n fairy friends, each of whom lives in their own magical fairy<br />home. There are n − 1 roads that each connect to exactly two homes, and Claire-y can travel<br />from one house to another via the road between them, if it exists. After traveling for a bit,<br />Claire-y comes to a twinkling realization: she can always get from any house to any other house<br />by traveling on these roads. As a former CIS 1600 student, she immediately realizes that the<br />graph G = (V,E) where V is the set of magical fairy homes and E is the set of roads must be<br />a tree. Prove that Claire-y is correct</p>
<p></p>
<p>I understand the question as &#34;prove that if we have a connected graph with n-1 edges and n vertices, then it is a tree. &#34;</p>
<p>Yes, I just realized that I can directly prove that it&#39;s connected because it&#39;s stated that &#34;she can always get from any house to any other house by traveling on these roads.&#34;</p>

<p>I&#39;m having trouble with proving this side of the statement in Q6:</p>
<p>Ishaan realizes that no matter how he creates A and B, there will always be at least one bridge that connects a mountain top in A to a mountain top in B. Prove that this implies Ishaan can travel from any mountain top to any other mountain top.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I&#39;m proving by contradiction. I assume that Ishaan cannot travel between two arbitrary vertices u and v, and then I don&#39;t know how I could reach to a contradiction. </p>
<p>Can we deem the case $$T=T'$$ trivial?</p>
<p>Does the question at any point imply that you can reach any mountain top in A from any other mountain top in A? For instance why can&#39;t this graph exist:</p>

<p>Because the question indicates that &#34;<strong>no matter how</strong> Ishaan creates A and B, there will always be at least one bridge that connects a mountain top in A to a mountain top in B&#34;.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In your example, Ishaan could have chosen the &#34;top two&#34; mountains in the left oval as A, and the remaining four for B, and there would be no such bridge.</p>

<p>Before midterm, I asked about HW6 Q1 in office hours about the base case. Apparently the equation still holds when the power is -1 so the TAs said my proof is also valid. I think it was Darren and Sydney who were in the office hour. I know the regrade deadline&#39;s passed but will it be possible to get points back since this is also valid? Thank you.</p>

You don’t need to cite anything if you are using maximal path, as it is simply a graph property. You should only cite if you are making a nontrivial conclusion that we have proved elsewhere, and for that, you do not need to cite WOP

<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p></p>
<p>We&#39;ve just published a midpoint feedback survey on Canvas in Module 13: <a href="https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1703231/quizzes/3052798?module_item_id=26623972" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1703231/quizzes/3052798?module_item_id=26623972</a></p>

<p>This is an entirely optional, anonymous survey meant to help us improve the course as TA&#39;s. While this isn&#39;t mandatory, it would be really helpful to us as a staff if you took some time to fill out this survey and give us any feedback about how to make the course experience better for you, so if you have time, please fill out the survey! </p>

<p>We made a mistake and when we reposted the homework to fix something minor, we included the solutions too! We were alerted to this by many wonderful students among you, and we thank them.<br /><br />So now, the instructor, that’s me, Val, has to make a decision what to do with this homework. Working on this problems is going to be very very useful for you all as you prepare for the final exam. The final is cumulative  but graph theory problems will constitute most of its content. That’s why I do not want to take the easy way out (for me) and just cancel this homework. <br /><br />While I am persuaded that that best thing students could do for their preparation is to ignore the solutions if they accessed them, some possibly will not. Others, who did not access the solutions, will feel that those who did have an unfair advantage.<br /><br />So we will continue with this homework and we will grade it very carefully. The students whose submitted solutions appear to be copied from those we published will not be able to use the score of this homework to improve their average. This homework simply will not count for them (we still drop their two lowest).<br /><br />(If you worry about how we can tell, it’s the same as when we see common solutions among students.)<br /><br />What to do to avoid this as you submit this homework. If you do not have the solutions, nothing. Including not trying to procure them from another student who might have them. If you have the solutions, don’t read them (I know, I know, easy for me to say it…)<br /><br />I am very sorry to add these concerns to your work in this course. Please believe me that I am only thinking of the benefits for the students and  the fairness involved.<br /><br />Val</p>

<p>Should we prove for even values of l &gt;=6? Is there a ceiling/floor associated with the number of feisty wizards? Or does the expression for the number of feisty wizards not carry over from 1a?</p>

<md>Do we have to prove that adding a leaf to a tree produces a tree?</md>
<p>&#34;There is at most one pathway between every pair of gardens. Additionally, the map<br />shows that you can always travel from garden g1 to garden g2 (for an arbitrary pair of gardens<br />g1, g2) via a sequence of paths.&#34;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I&#39;m having a hard time determining how you could create a spanning tree from a tree (I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible). Based on this part of the question, wouldn&#39;t G be a tree by lecture proposition because it&#39;s connected and each garden pair has one unique path between them(can&#39;t be 0 because connected)? </p>
<p>In question 1b, can we use induction if we assume the proposition to be true for k and prove it&#39;s true for k&#43;3. This is because the number of wizards must increase by increments of 3 by the proposition we proved true in part 1a.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Would this work or does this make induction invalid?</p>
<p>When it says &#34;Some pairs of mountain tops are connected via a bridge which allows him to travel from one top to another,&#34; does that mean he is able to travel from any mountain top to any other mountain top?</p>

<p>Let $$G=(V, E)$$ be minimally connected. Do we have to prove that if we took out some arbitrary $$e\in E$$, call the new graph $$G'$$, $$G'$$ would now become disconnected and there exists two cc&#39;s in $$G'$$?</p>

<p>Hi Professor and TA&#39;s, </p>
<p>I hope this note finds you well. I reviewed the post that addressed the homework policy for this week that outlines how this homework (#9) will be graded. I just recently went to office hours where I essentially asked: if the homework answers had already been viewed, is there a way for this homework to not count for our grade? It goes without saying that even though I had gotten rid of the answers after seeing them, I believe that it is still impossible for me to complete this homework without subconsciously following the same line of reasoning that was presented in the solutions. For this reason, I am asking if I can have this homework not count towards my grade: neither hurting it nor helping it. I can obviously complete this assignment still if that is the best course of action, but I am an honest person, and I thought it would be best for me to be as honest as possible through this note. Thank you! </p>

<p>How is the correct answer of 15 obtained?</p>
<p>Let $$K_5 = (V, E)$$ where $$V = \{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5\}$$ and $$(v_i, v_j) \in E \quad \forall i, j$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Step 1: Choose 4 vertices. This can be done in $$\binom{5}{4}$$ ways.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Suppose, WLOG, the vertices we chose were $$v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Step 2: Create a cycle out of them. We can do this in three ways:</p>
<p>1. $$v_1 - v_2 - v_3 - v_4$$</p>
<p>2. $$v_1 - v_3 - v_2 - v_4$$</p>
<p>3. $$v_1 - v_3 - v_4 - v_2 $$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By MR, we have: $$\binom{5}{4} \cdot 3 = 15$$</p>

<p>Hi. I submitted Hw8 regrade request but it does not seem to be processed yet. Is this normal? Thank you</p>
<p>Does every bunny have a partnership with another bunny?</p>
<p>When you say he has created the right amount of samples does that mean that each TA gets m samples or 1 sample each? I think im confused with what I am supposed to prove.</p>
<p>So if I am making the claim they are not related for (a) or (b), that means I&#39;m saying none of &#34;less than, less than or equal to, equal to, greater than or equal to, greater than&#34; hold between the two quantities for every graph G? How I am interpreting &#34;related&#34; is related through an equality or inequality.</p>
<p>I was wondering if the &#34;longest path&#34; in 2b referred to the maximal or maximum path. I was thinking the latter based on the choice of word &#34;longest&#34; but just wanted to make sure I wasn&#39;t misinterpreting this.</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Existence proofs:</strong> To prove a statement of the form ∃x ∈ S,P(x), we give either a constructive or a non-contructive proof. In a constructive proof, one proves the statement by exhibiting a specific x ∈ S such that P(x) is true. In a non-constructive proof, one proves the statement using an indirect proof such as a proof by contradiction. Thus, one might prove that the negation ∀x ∈ S,∼ P(x) is false by deriving a contradiction.</p>

A clique of size three is equivalent to a cycle of length 3
so if i a clique of at least 3 exists it is a given there must be a cycle of length 3
Maybe! It&#39;s a helpful exercise to argue to yourself why this may or may not be true!

If a graph has exactly 1 odd length cycle, is that cycle a disjoint odd length cycle?
does this cycle share eggs with itself?
Let this cycle be $$C$$, $$C$$ and $$C$$ are two odd length cycles in the project that share eggs with each other. Is this statement correct for our sake?
as an example, if we want to show a &lt; b then can we assume for the sake of contradiction that a &gt;= b and then show the contradiction to complete the proof? or does that assume what we&#39;re trying to prove and make the proof pattern invalid?
I made a proof by contrapositive for question one. I then thought I got it wrong and redid the question via contradiction. Then, I reviewed by original answer and it was actually correct. I now have two solutions. Should I choose one solution to submit, or can I include them both?
Is there only one clique of n-2 bunnies in question 3? From the wording of the question, it seems ambiguous.

You could. It may also be worthwhile to determine if it <em>matters</em> whether or not there are more than 1 of these cliques.

I&#39;m not really sure I understand what you mean. David will handle the carving.
I mean, it says &#34;Let x be the number of distinct topological sorts of David’s labyrinth before creating the new chamber.&#34; So does this mean that David already carved the chamber out? And what I need to do is to decide where to dig the new channel?

<p>&#34;The resulting tree, call it $$T'$$ has height $$k$$. By the IH, $$T'$$ has $$\geq 2k + 1$$ nodes. Since we removed $$\geq 2$$ nodes, our original tree $$T$$ by re-introducing the nodes we removed, has $$\geq (2k + 1) + 2 = 2(k+1) + 1$$ nodes.&#34;</p>

I wonder if it would be possible to prove this with induction on the number of strings? Thank you so much
Yep induction would be possible albeit a bit overkill. In the IS, you would split the nodes into two groupings of size $$2^k$$, apply IH on both groups and argue that there are no coloring conflicts between the two groups. You’d realize that the induction proof and the solution we have provided have high overlap.

Yes to the first question. The second question almost has an answer of &#34;yes&#34;. The only thing you would have to watch out for in the undirected setting is that your walk is length 3 or longer. Because in undirected graphs, you cannot have a length 2 cycle.

You do not consider isomorphisms with colorings, because a coloring is defined to be a function $$f: V \mapsto \{1, \ldots k\}$$. So having vertex $$a$$ colored with color $$2$$, for example, would be different from vertex $$a$$ being colored with color $$1$$.

<p>To those that attended my review session earlier today, here&#39;s an example when events are pairwise independent but not mutually independent.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We roll 2 dice, and let:</p>
<p>A = event the sum of the die is odd (Pr(A) = 1/2)</p>
<p>B = event the first dice is even (Pr(B) = 1/2)</p>
<p>C - event the second dice is even (Pr(C) = 1/2)</p>
<p></p>
<p>If we work out the probabilities, we see that the A, B and C are all pairwise independent.</p>
<p>However, Pr(A∩B∩C) = 0, which is not the same as Pr(A) x Pr(B) x Pr(C).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Also note that mutual independence implies pairwise independence, but not vice versa.</p>

I remember the professor had talked about how questions are ordered increasingly more difficult on the midterms. I was wondering if that was the same for the final exam, where the questions are supposedly ordered from least to most difficult.

&#34;difficulty&#34; is subjective, thus making this question challenging to accurately answer. The ordering of problems should be relatively similar to what you saw on the previous midterms.

<p>It is NOT true that with each edge we add, the number of cycles in $$G$$ will increase by exactly 1. Take, for example, $$G = (V, E)$$ with $$V = \{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\}$$ and $$E = \{(v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3), (v_3, v_4)$$. This graph is a tree with zero cycles. Adding the edge $$(v_4, v_1)$$ creates a single cycle. However, if we were to add another edge (while still including $$(v_4, v_1)$$), say $$(v_1, v_3)$$, then the resulting graph has $$3$$ cycles.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It follows that the answer to your &#34;related&#34; question is no.</p>
Then do we have that &#34;in an undirected tree, with each edge we add, there will be<em> at least</em> 1 new cycle formed&#34;?

Hi, For question 1 on hw10, would it be valid to prove by contradiction. For example, say &#34;consider a graph with n vertices and 1 distinct spanning tree&#34; and then prove that n edges implies more than 1 distinct spanning tree. In the hw answers, it only shows contrapositive

<p>This claim is saying that if you start with a tree, no matter which edge you add to it (so long as it does not already exist), the resulting graph will be not bipartite.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To prove this, you would need to show that for ANY edge you add to the tree, the graph will not be bipartite. Thus, you cannot just give a single example of an edge.</p>

$$\sum_{v \in V} \deg(v) = 2|E|$$. This tells us that the sum of the degrees of the vertices must be an even number. If there were an odd number of vertices, then $$\sum_{v \in V} \deg(v)$$ would be odd (the sum of and odd amount of odd numbers is odd), but that&#39;s a contradiction.

The range is the set of values in the codomain that are being mapped to. That is, for a function $$g: X \mapsto Y$$, we have $$y \in Ran(g)$$ if $$\exists x \in X$$ such that $$g(x) = y$$. And we see that $$Ran(g) \subseteq Y$$.

<p>&#34;Assume, for the purpose of contradiction, that it is not a path. Then we must have some vertex v that appears more than once in P. Let P′ be the part of this walk that starts at v and then returns to v, and let v′ be the second-to-last vertex in P′. Since we have a walk from v to v′, we must also have a path from v to v′, so this path plus the edge v′ → v creates a directed cycle, contradicting the fact that slugs are acyclic.&#34;</p>

If we say vertices u and v connected, then does this mean that there is some path from u to v? Is it okay to say directly connected, neighboring, or adjacent interchangeably when we want to say that there is an edge between u and v?

Do we have to prove that in a DAG there must be a path from an arbitrary vertice v to a sink and that there is a path from a source to V? Also, for HW11 Q2, do we not have to say anything for the case where there is a direct path from a to b without going to a sink, back to a source, then back again? Because if there is, then won&#39;t there be an overlap of vertices?

<p>Below is screenshot from the graph induction review section. How come reintroducing $$u$$ with $$\leq d$$ edges is sufficient for the induction step? Let us introduce a vertex with $$d \leq l < k+1$$ degrees, we end up with a graph with $$k+1$$ vertices and $$m-d+l$$ edges and this graph is not covered in our IS. How does the proof address this example? </p>
<p></p>
<p>Or is it because after we reintroduce $$u$$, the graph has to again have exactly $$m$$ edges so $$u$$ can bring in at most $$d$$ edges? If so, why?</p>

I am confused on what to have as our base case for induction on graphs. For certain problems with restrictions (for example we are dealing with cycles) then I assume we can start with n=3 but for questions without specifics on where n starts (sth like n &gt;=4) then do we just start base case with 1 vertice?

<p>It says that a walk is a non-empty sequence. Can a path be empty sequence? Because I think I saw problems where we state paths of length 0. But where there is a walk there is a path - doesn&#39;t this mean we need walks of length 0 too? Also, does this differ for directed graphs? </p>
<p></p>
<p>Furthermore, it says u and v are connected if there exists some walk with endpoints u and v, but a graph is connected if there is a path between every pair of vertices. Does it not matter if it&#39;s a walk or path?</p>
How can the P4 and its comlement be isomorphisms of each other? P4 has a vertex of degree one (first or last vertex of path), but complement of P4 has no vertices of degree one, so I can&#39;t see how the two are isomorphisms.

For 4b, why is the answer not 6n(n-1) &#43; 6n(n-1)(n-2)? Would the paths of length 3 be different if you started the path with a blue vertex instead of a red vertex, which is why you would also add 6n(n-1)(n-2) to account for paths starting with blue vertex?
I might just be drawing a blank, but how do we count the number of subgraphs in a graph given n vertices, or is this not something that we can immediately do.
I might just be drawing a blank, but how do we count the number of subgraphs in a graph given n vertices, or is this not something that we can immediately do.
uhhh this is not something that is super easy to calculate, because the standard counting procedure would be to count how many vertex sets we could have (which would be $$2^n$$), but determining the number of subgraphs for a particular subset of vertices is kinda hard. If you want a really trivial bound, we could say that the number of subgraphs is $$\leq 2^n \cdot 2^m$$ for an n-vertex graph with m-edges. But this is not super useful.

for 1, something like @1626 would be fine where you provide a coloring and justify why it is bipartite. For 2, the answer is 4.
why is #2 4, not 5? when you remove 2 edges, isn’t there still a vertex with a degree of 4 in G? 
The maximum degree of a graph is not the lower bound for the amount of colors needed to color a graph. Consider a graph that is a tree with a central vertex which has a bunch of neighbors and nothing else. The max degree is much larger than 2, but the graph is 2-colorable
why is #2 4, not 5? when you remove 2 edges, isn’t there still a vertex with a degree of 4 in G? 
I see, how do you get to the answer 4? What is the general process to find chromatic number for a specific graph?
why is #2 4, not 5? when you remove 2 edges, isn’t there still a vertex with a degree of 4 in G? 
It turns out that computing the chromatic number of an arbitrary graph is extremely difficult computationally (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check this out for further reading</a>)! For our purposes, trial-and-error usually works best. But it&#39;s always good to keep in mind some facts we know about coloring (i.e. trees are bipartite, even cycles are bipartite, etc).

Are we allowed to state that if a directed graph is strongly connected/has SCCs with more than one vertex, it has directed cycle(s)?
<p>I know that dags need to have at least once source and one sink. However, if i&#39;m correct, DAG&#39;s do not have to be connected. Therefore, why for part 2b do we assume that for any arbitrary vertice there is a path from the source to that vertice and a path from that vertice to a sink.

<p>Here, are we not overcounting because we are specifically designating head TAs? If the question was that 2 TA&#39;s get 2 or more papers, is this still the correct way to solve? Then, we can choose TA 1 and TA 2 to be the ones that get 2 or more papers and still give TA 3 2 or more papers, and we can also choose TA 2 and TA 3 and repeat it but they seem like the same thing. </p>

If we want to distribute n stars to r people but we want all of them to have at least 1 star and exactly 3 of them to have at least 2 stars, how do we solve the problem? Also, what would happen if it was at least 3 people instead of exactly 3?
<p>If there are $$n$$ people, and exactly 3 of them must have at least 2 star and the remaining $$n-3$$ people must have at least one star, then it must be the case that the $$n-3$$ people all have exactly one star. So give those people all one star, then do stars &amp; bars with the remaining stars amongst the 3 people left. </p>
<p></p>
<p>For the second question, you could probably do some complementary counting PIE type stuff.</p>
Sorry I don&#39;t understand - I have r people. I want all of them to have at least 1 star so I distribute them by subtracting r from n. Then, I want exactly 3 people to have at least 2. Does it suffice to just subtract 3 more from n-r? And then we do stars and bars?
well, when you do this, the remaining people will have 1 star (that they received from the first step) &#43; more that they get from the last step. This would mean that you would have more than 3 people with at least 2 stars (whereas you wanted <strong>exactly </strong>3 people with at least 2 stars).
