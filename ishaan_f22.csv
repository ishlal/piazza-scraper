"QUESTION: <p>hi im just a little bit confused on the difference between the set &#39;belongs to&#39; another set and the set is a &#39;subset&#39; of another set</p>
<p></p>
<p>so the &#39;belongs to&#39; for a set is only referring to one element and whether that element is present in the set,</p>
<p></p>
<p>while for the &#39;subset&#39; part it is when you consider a whole set and see if that whole set is within another set?</p>

","ANSWER: <p>Your definition for &#34;belongs to&#34; is correct.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One way of thinking about &#34;subset&#34; is &#34;A is a subset of B if every element of A is also an element of B&#34;. So for example, if $$A = \{1, 2\}$$ and $$B = \{1, 2, 3\}$$, then $$A \subseteq B$$, because every element of A is also an element of B. But if $$A = \{1, 4\}$$ and $$B = \{1, 2, 3\}$$ then $$A \nsubseteq B$$</p>

"QUESTION: <p>Currently, I&#39;m trying to explore possible ways to solve this question with the 2^9 = 512 hint in mind. </p>
<p></p>
<p>One avenue is powerset (P(S) with cardinality defined as 2^n), though I&#39;m not sure what using that would mean. The subsets would be all the possible combinations of elements in S. I thought about setting up the nine TAs as the nine elements, but that doesn&#39;t seem particularly useful.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The other option I&#39;m juggling at the moment is more of a Step 1, Step 2, etc. based approach like the one we saw in lecture on Thursday. I originally thought of constructing a binary tree (9 rounds and two options per round - faulty fork or no faulty fork which would&#39;ve come out to 512 total permutations). I quickly realized this also makes no sense (it&#39;s redundant - why do the 8 other TAs need to check the fork if TA #1 already determined its status?). </p>
<p></p>
<p>Am I missing something here or am I assuming something wrong with my current two approaches? </p>

Use that fact in conjunction with the other information you know about $$x$$ to come up with an answer! you seem to have a lot of the facts nailed down.

"QUESTION: <p>I don&#39;t quite understand how we&#39;re supposed to identify the faulty fork individually... Do the TAs know immediately if they have eaten with the faulty fork? Or do they have to wait until 8:59 to know whether a fork they ate with was faulty? Is this question just asking about the most efficient way to iterate through the 509 forks with the TAs?</p>
","ANSWER: <p>The TA(s) who have eaten with the faulty fork will only know they have eaten with it at 8:59. The question is not asking you to find the most efficient way. You just need to come up with a way to successfully identify the faulty fork for certain.</p>

"QUESTION: <p>In the Lecture example: &#34;How many odd numbers between 1000 and 9999 have distinct digits?&#34; </p>
<p>why does the multiplication rule still apply? For example, the number of ways performing step 4 depends upon whether a zero was chosen in the earlier steps.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Also in the president, secretary, treasurer question, the solution says multiplication rule does not apply because outcome of prior step changes later # outcomes. What&#39;s the logic that distinguishes the approaches to these two questions? </p>
<p></p>
<p>Is it that in a question in which there are multiple ways of performing the steps, only one sequence of steps allows multiplication rule to be applied and other sequences of events do not? thank you.</p>
","ANSWER: <p>Note that only Attempt 3 shows a correct solution for the &#34;odd numbers&#34; question. In that attempt, we can see that we will not select the number zero in steps 1 and 2. Only the second digit and the third digit can be zeroes, which is why they are placed last in our ordering of steps. But these steps also acknowledge the fact that, for example, the second digit cannot be the same as the first or fourth digit (whose digits have already been chosen), which is why there are 10 - 2 = 8 ways to perform step 3. And similar logic holds for step 4.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure I completely understand your second question, but I&#39;ll try my best to give some information that may clear things up. Steps within your process that you develop for counting CAN depend on each other, but we can only perform MR when each step has a CONSTANT number of ways of being performed. For example, in attempt 1 of the &#34;secretary&#34; question, the third step can be performed in 2 ways if, for example, Bob is President and Ann is Treasurer, 1 way if, for example, Bob is president and Clyde is secretary, or 0 ways if, for example, Clyde is president and Dan is secretary. Since this is NOT a constant value, the MR can&#39;t really be used.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Whereas, in attempt 2, since we chose the secretary first, the remaining two steps always have the same constant number of people to choose from.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For your last question, no. There can be many ways of ordering the steps. You just need to be sure that the ordering of the steps meets the above rule of that constant value for each step.</p>
<p></p>
<p>hope that made a bit of sense!</p>

I know the post says that closed form is the default, but it also says that a reminder would usually be included for cases where an open form solution is viable and it seems like for Q6 an open form solution at the very least may <em>seem </em>viable based on the potential summation of a number of elements dependent on <em>n</em>.</p>

"QUESTION: <p>Hi! I have an approach for question 2 that I&#39;m not so sure about. I&#39;m pretty much representing a three-way venn diagram as sets. For example, let set A contain only silver dresses, set B contains only silver/tan dresses, set E contains only silver/tan/red dresses, and set D contains only silver/red dresses. Each of these sets can be empty. Then, let set S represent sets that contain silver dresses, so that S = {A, B, D, E}. Is this rigorous enough to go through the questions and do actual operations on?</p>
","ANSWER: <p>These Venn Diagram-esque approaches are good for gaining insight into what the sets will look like after the operations are performed on them, but do not suffice as a rigorous proof.

"QUESTION: How does this word influence how we do counting?
","ANSWER: <p>Let&#39;s consider two similar questions:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Question 1: How many ways are there to give two <strong>distinguishable</strong> watches to two distinguishable people such that each person gets a watch.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Solution: Let $$A$$ be the first watch and $$B$$ be the second watch. Let $$X$$ be the first person and let $$Y$$ be the second person. Then we have two distributions: $$((A, X), (B, Y))$$ and $$((A, Y), (B, X)$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Question 2: How many ways are there to give two <strong>indistinguishable </strong>watches to two distinguishable people such that each person gets a watch.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Solution: Now, we <strong>cannot</strong> call our watches $$A$$ and $$B$$ because they are indistinguishable. Instead, we will call them both $$A$$. If our people are $$X$$ and $$Y$$, then we only have one distribution: $$((A, X), (A, Y))$$. </p>

"QUESTION: <p>What is the different between saying &#34;without loss of generality&#34; and &#34;arbitrary but particular&#34;? When would we use each?</p>
","ANSWER: <p>&#34;Without loss of generality&#34; is commonly used when making a claim for some variables. For example, I would say something like &#34;suppose $$a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$$, and without loss of generality, let $$a < b$$&#34;. And then I would do whatever math needed. In the instance that $$b < a$$, I wouldn&#39;t have to do any math because the &#34;symmetric&#34; argument is covered with &#34;Without Loss of Generality&#34;. That is to say, we can&#39;t just be throwing around WLOG whenever we want. We should only use it when the argument truly is symmetric.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#34;Arbitrary but Particular&#34; is usually used when describing an element of a set. We use this to indicate that there is &#34;nothing special&#34; about the element, and the argument for that element will hold for all elements of the set.</p>

However, I’m absolutely stuck on the left side.

"QUESTION: <p>For induction hypothesis, why do we say &#34;for some k&#34; instead of say &#34;for any k&#34;?</p>
","ANSWER: <p>great question. I think this comes down to how induction is built upon the idea of proving $$P(k) \implies P(k+1) \quad \forall k$$. Since it&#39;s hard to prove that implication for all values of k, if we show the implication to be true for an arbitrary value of $$k$$, then we don&#39;t have to worry about proving it for all $$k$$, because we would have already shown that since $$k$$ was arbitrary.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since $$k$$ is arbitrary, we say &#34;for some k&#34;, since we don&#39;t really know what $$k$$ is, but we just want it to be arbitrary.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I can&#39;t quite put my finger on why &#34;for any k&#34; may be incorrect because I think there are valid arguments on both sides (for it to be logically acceptable or not). One such argument is that &#34;for any&#34; may be an implication of strong induction, but not in an accurate way. But one could also argue that &#34;for any k&#34; can mean the same thing as &#34;for some k&#34;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Given this, my recommendation is to stick with convention and to just use &#34;for some k&#34;.</p>

<p>S_1 (no 2&#39;s) = 5! ways, since all are unique</p>
<p></p>
<p>S_2 (one 2) = choose place for a 2 (5 choose 1), then choose remaining unique items (5!/(5-4)!) </p>
<p></p>
<p>S_3 (two 2&#39;s) = choose positions for two 2&#39;s (5 choose 2), then choose remaining unique items (5!/(5-3)!)</p>
<p></p>
<p>But this could get tedious if we are working with a large number of items that have repetitions. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I guess my question is, can I somehow work the standard way of permuting multisets into this like in the lecture 3H on multisets? The problem is that not every element needs to have a position on the string... the total number of positions on the string doesn&#39;t add up to the total multiplicity of all the elements.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Also, will we get solutions to these at some point?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks</p>
","ANSWER: <p>yeah I think it&#39;s kind of hard to incorporate permuting multisets in this, because when we do those permutations, we have very few constraints. In this problem, we introduce a lot of constraints, and while it may be possible to incorporate these constraints by modifying how we permute the multisets, it gets (arguably) equally tedious.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Casing, though sometimes tedious, is usually quite effective, so you shouldn&#39;t rule it out immediately!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Also yeah, we&#39;ll be posting solutions sometime this weekend hopefully.</p>

"QUESTION: <p>In the Binomial Theorem, the notes say that a and b must be real numbers. With the 2^n example, I used (2 &#43; 0)^n and expanded using the binomial theorem. However, I didn&#39;t get the same answer as the lecture notes. Is that a fault in my calculation or should this work? </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
","ANSWER: <p>you can still use $$(2 + 0)^n$$, but you will arrive at something different than $$\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}$$, because when we did $$(1 + 1)^n$$, we were able to simplify nicely using the fact that $$1^m = 1$$ for any $$m$$, but we do not have that leverage when we do $$(2+0)^n$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>tldr: yeah it works, but it just gives you different information</p>

"QUESTION: <p>In the question in Lecture 4H, where we are proving that there exists a subsequence of consecutive integers whose sum is a multiple of n.</p>
<p></p>
<p>How did we conclude that we have n sums to apply PHP? Would the total number of possible sequences be n(n &#43; 1)/2? </p>
","ANSWER: <p>The total number of possible subsequences is indeed $$\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$, but we only chose to look at a subset of them so that we could proceed with the later steps of the problem (i.e. generating a new subsequence from two of our $$n$$ subsequences).</p>
"
"QUESTION: <p>for the practice midterm 1a, how can we get the 11 choose 3 term when it matters that katie and stephanie need to be in front of nishita</p>
","ANSWER: <p>the first step is just arbitrary selecting the three positions where these three lovely humans will be placed. The second step handles ordering them by abiding to the constraints. </p>
<p></p>
<p>So the first step of just choosing <em>where</em> they could appear (ignoring who goes in which spot) can be done in $$\binom{11}{3}$$ ways.</p>

"QUESTION: <p>I am looking at the following question in Lecture 3T:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Example. Show that there exist irrational numbers x and y such that x^y is rational.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What is the purpose of Case II in this question? I am also confused how this question can be proven simply by giving an example.</p>
","ANSWER: <p>Since the question is asking us to show existence, providing a true example would qualify as showing existence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We break it up into two cases because we don&#39;t really know whether $$\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$$ is rational or irrational. If it&#39;s rational, then great. But if not, then we can use this value to provide a different $$x$$ and $$y$$ where $$x^y$$ is rational.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In essence, we are &#39;pretending&#39; that we don&#39;t know whether or not $$\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$$ is rational, but regardless of its status, we can use it as is, or use it to create new values.</p>

"QUESTION: <p>When writing the induction hypothesis, do we need to restate the claim the way it is done in class?

In other words, assume that.......&#34; or is &#34;Assume that this claim is true for n = k, for some arbitrary but particular integer k&#34; sufficient?</p>
","ANSWER: <p>It is not a necessity, but it is something I highly encourage to do. This is because without restating the claim, there is a higher chance of ambiguity. But if you restate the claim in your IH, it is clear to the proof reader exactly what you are assuming.</p>

"QUESTION: <p>Can this be proved using weak induction by saying in case 2 that according to the fundamental thm of arithmetic, a composite number is a product of primes?</p>

","ANSWER: <p>This is not quite a proof for the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic because that theorem also mentions that the prime factorization is unique. That being said, strong induction is not needed for this proof. In fact, one can avoid induction completely by mentioning how the claim is just a corollary of the FTA, but for the purpose of example, we did a proof by strong induction.</p>

<p>2. Also, just to confirm, can we use anything proved in lecture on the exam without a proof (ie. sum of odds/evens, Pascal&#39;s Formula, cardinality of power set)? </p>
","ANSWER: <p>1. Given two distinct elements, $$a$$ and $$b$$, one must be larger than the other. So we are partitioning the set of all pairs into groupings based on what the largest value in the pair is.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So if, for example, $$S = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}$$, then we would have $$S_1 = \{(0, 1)\}$$, $$S_2 = \{(0, 2), (1, 2)\}$$, and $$S_3 = \{(0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3)\}$$. We partition like this because it is easy to calculate the cardinality of each $$S_i$$. Namely, $$|S_i| = i$$, but each $$S_i$$ is formed by the largest value in the pair.</p>

","ANSWER: <p>I would give a one sentence explanation in between each of the implications. So I would say $$p^2 = 6q^2 \implies 2\mid p^2$$ because since $$6q^2 = 2(3q^2)$$ is even, $$p^2$$ must also be even.</p>

If it&#39;s because there are &#34;four options&#34; for the first slot, and &#34;three options&#34; for the second slot, and so on, then you should be dividing by $$4!$$ because you&#39;ve already fixed the last card to be the non-four-of-a-kind.</p>

"QUESTION: <p>For the last question about deleting a leaf, how do we know that the leaf we&#39;re deleting is not a part of any other walks besides the one its deleted from, so that the graph remains connected?</p>
","ANSWER: <p>A leaf $$v$$, which has degree 1, can only be a part of path $$P$$ if one of $$P$$&#39;s endpoints is $$v$$. If otherwise, then suppose we have a path $$P'$$ where $$v$$ is within the path, but not one of the endpoints, then $$P' = ... - u - v - w - ....$$ which would mean that $$v$$ would have two neighbors, and hence degree 2 (contradiction).</p>
<p></p>
<p>So when we remove $$v$$, the only paths we lose are those that have endpoint $$v$$. But since $$T' = T \setminus \{v\}$$ has all vertices of $$T$$ except $$v$$, all paths between non-$$v$$ vertices in $$T$$ remain in $$T'$$, so it&#39;s connected.</p>

"QUESTION: <p>We have proven that a graph will have at least n-m connected components. However, if n=m (like a triangle) then n-m=0, which means that a graph will have at least 0 connected components. What does this mean? What if m&gt;n, so n-m&lt;0? What does that mean then?</p>
","ANSWER: <p>That fact is basically saying if $$|V| = n$$ and $$|E| = m$$, then $$|CC| \geq n - m$$, where we use the notation $$|CC|$$ to denote the number of connected components.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the case when $$n = m$$, then you can conclude that a graph has at least $$0$$ connected components, which is not too groundbreaking of a conclusion. In general, this fact does not give us much information when $$m \geq n$$, because you can always construct a connected graph with $$n$$ vertices and $$m$$ edges when $$m \geq n$$, and such a connected graph would only have $$1$$ connected component. This fact is more useful when $$m < n$$.</p>

We would think that we could construct a counting procedure in that we &#34;select p elements&#34; in step one and then &#34;select 1&#34; in the second step. But this will overcount some cases.</p>

<p>For example, suppose $$n = 4$$ and $$p = 2$$. And suppose our elements are $$\{A, B, C, D\}$$. Then we have to select $$p + 1 = 3$$ elements.

","ANSWER: <p>Instead of thinking of $$\frac{(n-1)!}{n!}$$ being computed as the product of probabilities, it is probably better to think of it as being computed as $$\frac{|E_i|}{|\Omega|}$$. The sample space is all ways that the $$n$$ people can get their hats back which means $$|\Omega| = n!$$. The event $$E_i$$ is the event that the $$i$$th person gets their hat back.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So you can think of $$|E_i|$$ as computing the amount of permutations of $$\{1, ..., n\}$$ where $$i$$ is in the $$i$$th spot. This can be done in $$(n-1)!$$ ways.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thus, $$Pr[E_i] = \mathbb{E}[X_i]= \frac{(n-1)!}{n!}$$</p>

<p></p>
<p>For example, inducting on vertices can sometimes be annoying because when you remove a vertex, you also have to remove all incident edges. But at the same time, inducting on vertices can be nice when you can guarantee existence of a specific type of vertex in a graph (i.e a leaf in a tree)</p>

","ANSWER: <p>For c, $$Pr[B] = \frac{|B|}{|\Omega|} = \frac{|\Omega|}{|\Omega|} = 1$$. To deem if $$A$$ and $$B$$ are independent, we need to check if $$Pr[A] \cdot Pr[B] = Pr[A \cap B]$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We have $$Pr[A] = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega} = \frac{3}{5}$$. And we have that $$A \cap B = \{a, b, c\}$$ so $$Pr[A \cap B] = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|\Omega|} = \frac{3}{5}$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>So since $$Pr[A] \cdot Pr[B] = \frac35 \cdot 1 = \frac35 = Pr[A \cap B]$$, we have that $$A$$ and $$B$$ are independent.</p>

<p></p>
<p>You can see that $$Pr[A] = Pr[B] = Pr[C] = \frac12$$. And we have that $$A \cap B \cap C = \{b\}$$, Thus, since $$Pr[A \cap B \cap C] \neq Pr[A] \cdot Pr[B] \cdot Pr[C]$$, we can conclude that A, B, and C are not mutually independent.</p>

","ANSWER: <p>An m-augmenting path must be of odd length. This is because an m-augmenting path <strong>is</strong> an m-alternating path. So if you consider an m-augmenting path that traverses the vertices in the following order: $$v_0, v_1, v_2, ..., v_{2k+1}$$, we have by definition that $$v_0$$ and $$v_{2k+1}$$ are unsaturated, which means that $$\{v_0, v_1\}$$ is not in the matching, but $$\{v_1, v_2\}$$ must be. And $$\{v_2, v_3\}$$ is not in the matching, but $$\{v_3, v_4\}$$ is. Note that in order for the endpoint of the path to be unsaturated, we need $$\{v_i, v_{i+1}\}$$ to not be in the matching (where $$v_{i+1}$$ is the endpoint), which means that (by our pattern), $$i+1$$ is odd.

"QUESTION: <p>Are vertices in a set excluded from the neighbors of the set?</p>

","ANSWER: <p>I guess this depends. Like if your graph had vertices $$u$$ and $$v$$, and the only edge in the graph was $$u - v$$, then for set $$S = \{u, v\}$$, we have $$N(S) = \{u, v\}$$, and so $$u \in N(S)$$ and $$v \in N(S)$$</p>
<p></p>

"QUESTION: <p>I&#39;m a bit confused about the definition of a Ramsey number; how can a complete graph be 2-colored? If every vertex has an edge from every other vertex, for say the example of R(3,3)&lt;=6, I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s possible for that graph to be 2-colored.</p>
","ANSWER: <p>Here, the term &#34;coloring&#34; just means that we are assigning colors to the edges without the constraint of edges incident to the same vertex having different colors. So the Ramsey number is saying if $$R(k, l) = n$$, then for <strong>any</strong> assignment of colors (either red or blue) to the edges of the complete graph on $$n$$ vertices, you can find a red clique of size $$k$$ or a blue clique of size $$l$$.</p>

"QUESTION: <p>Hello, </p>
<p>I&#39;m looking over lecture notes to prepare for the final and I have a question about one of the examples. In lecture 10h, there is an example problem calculating the variance of the hat problem we did in lecture 9h. When we are calculating the variance, the problem calculates $$E[X^{2}]$$ as follows:</p>
<p>$$E[X^{2}]= \sum_{i=1}^{n} E[X_{i}^{2}] + 2 \sum_{i<j}E[X_iX_j]$$</p>
<p>Where $$X_{i}$$ is if the ith person gets their hat back. I&#39;m wondering why we split the one variable i into 2, i and j. Where does the second summation term come from? Thank you </p>
","ANSWER: <p>We defined indicators in such a way that $$X = X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n$$. So $$\mathbb{E}[X^2] = \mathbb{E}[(X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n)^2] = \mathbb{E}[(X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n)(X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n)] $$</p>
<p></p>
<p>Multiply the two expressions to get: </p>
<p>$$\mathbb{E}[X_1X_1 + X_1X_2 + ... + X_1X_n + X_2X_1 + X_2X_2 + .... + X_2X_n + ... + X_nX_1 + X_nX_2 + ... + X_nX_n]$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>We&#39;ll &#34;group together&#34; terms of the form $$X_iX_i$$, so we have:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\mathbb{E}[X_1X_1 + X_2X_2 + ... + X_nX_n + X_1X_2 + X_1X_3 + ... + X_nX_{n-1}]$$ (just rearranging the terms in a friendly way here).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Use LOE: </p>
<p>$$\mathbb{E}[X_1X_1] + \mathbb{E}[X_2X_2] + ... + \mathbb{E}[X_nX_n] + \mathbb{E}[X_1X_2] + \mathbb{E}[X_1X_3] + ... + \mathbb{E}[X_nX_{n-1}]$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first $$n$$ terms can be grouped into one summation, and the last terms will have their own summation:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{E}[X_iX_i] + \sum_{i \neq j, 1 \leq i, j \leq n} \mathbb{E}[X_iX_j]$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, we can just rewrite some terms to match the expression:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{E}[X_i^2] + 2 \sum_{i < j} \mathbb{E}[X_iX_j]$$. Note that the bounds of $$i$$ and $$j$$ are held implicitly in the second summation.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Here delta = k: max degree delta is within the bounds of &#34;at most k&#34;, so wouldn&#39;t that make the graph delta&#43;1 colorable? Thank you!</p>
","ANSWER: <p>The chromatic number refers to the <strong>minimum </strong>number of colors needed to color the graph. So while a graph with maximum degree $$\Delta$$ is $$\Delta + 1$$ colorable, there are some graphs with max degree $$\Delta$$ that can be colored in less than $$\Delta + 1$$ colors.</p>

"QUESTION: <p>In class today, we proved that in any planar graph with $$n$$ vertices $$\delta(G) \leq 5$$ by assuming for contradiction. In class, we assumed that $$\delta(G) \geq 6$$, after which the proof follows as such:</p>
<p></p>
<p>          $$\sum_{v \in V}deg(v) \geq 6n$$, and so by handshake lemma $$2|E| = \sum_{v \in V}deg(v) \geq 6n$$. or that $$|E| \geq 3n$$.</p>
<p>          Using the corollary proved in class that in a planar graph with at least 2 edges, $$|E| \leq 3|V| - 6$$, we have that $$3n \leq 3n - 6$$, or that $$0 \leq -6$$, a clear contradiction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, if you assume for contradiction that $$\delta(G) > 5$$, we have the following:</p>
<p></p>
<p>          $$\sum_{v \in V}deg(v) > 5n$$, and so by handshake lemma $$2|E| = \sum_{v \in V}deg(v) > 5n$$. or that $$|E| > \frac{5n}{2}$$.</p>
<p>          Using the corollary proved in class that in a planar graph with at least 2 edges, $$|E| \leq 3|V| - 6$$, we have that $$\frac{5n}{2} < 3n - 6$$, or that $$n > 12$$. This doesn&#39;t seem to be a contradiction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Clearly, the proof doesn&#39;t follow when assuming $$\delta(G) > 5$$, so why does it work when assuming $$\delta(G) \leq 6$$ rather than $$\delta(G) > 5$$? </p>
","ANSWER: <p>It&#39;s mainly due to the strictness of the bound. While saying that $$\sum_{v \in V} deg(v) > 5n$$ is not false, the value of $$5n$$ is a weak lower bound. We can see this because (for non-trivial values of $$n$$) we would also be able to say $$\sum_{v \in V} deg(v) > 5n+1$$ or $$\sum_{v \in V} deg(v) > 5n + 2$$ and so on. And those claims would indeed be true. Since &#34;degree&#34; takes on an integer value, when considering the sum, it is best to lower bound by the absolute minimum value of the degree (that a vertex can have), which in this case is $$6$$. Then, we have a much stricter lower bound, which helps with the calculations</p>

<p>How did we get from Pr[Xi=1] to (n-1/n)^n?</p>
","ANSWER: <p>$$X_i$$ is an indicator that is $$1$$ when the $$i$$th bin is empty. In other words, for each of the $$n$$ balls, we want them to land in a bin other than bin $$n$$. Thus, for a given ball, there are $$n-1$$ &#34;good&#34; bins that it can fall into (we subtract 1 to <strong>remove</strong> bin i). There are $$n$$ total bins. So the probability that a single ball does not fall into bin $$i$$ is $$\frac{n-1}{n}$$. Use independence to see that the probability that <strong>all $$n$$ </strong>balls do not fall into bin $$i$$ is $$(\frac{n-1}{n})^n)$$. Thus, $$Pr[X_i = 1] = (\frac{n-1}{n})^n$$</p>

"QUESTION: <p>For the example where we prove that the complete bipartite graph of 3,3 is not planar could we use |E| &lt;= 3|V| - 6 or is there a reason we have to use |E| &lt;= 2|V| - 4</p>
","ANSWER: <p>Note $$K_{3, 3}$$ has $$|V| = 6$$ and $$|E| = 9$$. We use $$|E| \leq 2|V| - 4$$ to reach the contradiction (because it is tighter than $$3|V| - 6$$). If we were to use $$|E| \leq 3|V| - 6$$, then we get $$9 \leq 3 \cdot 6 - 6$$ which is a true statement and does not arrive at a contradiction</p>

"QUESTION: <p>To get the number of ways in which Selena can get a music drive, we had to multiply c*(n-1 choose p); in this procedure, we are first selecting one of c music drives for selena and then choosing p drives to be selected by the first person from the n-1 remaining drives. I&#39;m not sure how to reconcile this with the fact that the when the first person selects, they could have taken any number of music drives with their p, meaning there could be less than c options for Selena? Is there a reverse way of figuring out the cardinality of this event by partitioning it over the number of music drives that were taken by the first person?</p>
","ANSWER: <p>yeah the way around this would be to case based on the number of drives with music remaining, but this is quite challenging and time consuming to do, which is why we &#34;reverse&#34; the procedure. It probably still is possible to solve it by case work and just use the addition rule at the end. I&#39;ll think about this some more and maybe try to sketch up a solution if I find the time.</p>

"QUESTION: <p>Can every 3D object that doesn&#39;t have any holes in it (nothing topologically equivalent to a donut or other things) be converted into a planar graph and likewise, can every planar graph be converted into a 3D representation. Every corner where at least 3 edges meet can be a vertex. I have tried a few examples and it seems to hold so far. Every tree would just be a sphere like object. The version of the handshake lemma where you sum up the degree of the faces also works for the objects. The reason why I specified that the object should have no holes is because there ends up being extra faces in the planar graph. The space inside the hole, which should be counted as the out side graph face, becomes an inner face, so the lemma doesn&#39;t work. </p>

","ANSWER: if i’m getting this right, then this seems like u know when u make a 3d box/object from a cardboard u can always draw a scheme of it on a sheet of paper and then u cut the outer shape and by simply bending some of the other drawn edges u can make a 3d object? so the scheme of ur 3d object on that cardboard is basically a planar graph. thus from this example it seems like ur right and any 3d object can def be converted into a planar graph in 2d. i know it didn’t prove much srry just sharing what came first to mind :’)

<p>Could I get some help on how this work was derived, especially the first two lines?</p>
","ANSWER: <p>The first line is using the law of total expectation. For the second line, we have that $$Pr[Y = 1] = p$$ because that is the probability of success on the first trial. In the case that the first trial was successful, we stop with the procedure, and we have $$X = 1$$. So that would mean $$E[X] = 1$$ and $$E[X^2] = 1$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>If the first trial was unsuccessful, then we have $$Y = 0$$, and this occurs with probability $$(1-p)$$. Then we &#34;ignore&#34; this trial, and consider the expected number of trials to get a success, but we add one for the failed trial that we just had, so we have $$E[X^2 | Y = 0] = E[(X+1)^2]$$. </p>

","ANSWER: <p>$$H$$ is a binomial random variable and the variance of a binomial random variable $$X$$ is given by $$Var[X] = np(1-p)$$. So in the context of the problem we have $$n = 100$$ trials, and $$p = \frac12 = 0.5$$</p>

"QUESTION: <p>How is Pr[n=k] always 1/11? Because there is no replacement, isn&#39;t Pr[n=1] = 1/11, Pr[n=2] = 2/10, Pr[n=3] = 3/9, etc.? </p>
","ANSWER: <p>$$Pr[n=2]$$ can be calculating the probability that you do not get the candy bar you like on the first trial multiplied with the probability that you get it on the second trial. </p>
<p></p>
<p>There is a $$\frac{10}{11}$$ chance of not getting the candy bar you like on the first trial. After this, the candy bar you have received has run out in the vending machine, so there are only 10 candy bars left, one of which is your favorite. So the probability that you get your favorite candy bar on the second trial is $$\frac{1}{10}$$. So we have $$Pr[n=2] = \frac{10}{11} \cdot \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{11}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can use this same process for all values of $$k$$, and see that it is always true that $$Pr[n = k] = \frac{1}{11}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another way of arguing the probability is by considering the sample space being permutations of the candy bars. The event of interest is that the candy bar you like is in the $$k$$th position. The cardinality of the sample space is $$11!$$. The cardinality of the event set is $$1 \cdot (11-1)! = 10!$$. So the probability of the event is $$\frac{10!}{11!} = \frac{1}{11}$$</p>

"QUESTION: <p>Hi,</p>

","ANSWER: Yeah I think following the proof format of how we proved $$\sqrt{2}$$ is irrational for this problem would be kind of tough (mostly because the multiplicity of 2 in 40’s prime factorization is not 1). The way I would go about proving this is noting that $$\sqrt{40} = 2\sqrt{10}$$ and then showing that $$\sqrt{10}$$ is irrational (which is easier to do). Finally you can conclude that an irrational multiplied with a non-zero rational is irrational.

"How did we get from the second to third line?</md>
","ANSWER: <p>$$E[X_i]$$ was previously calculated to be $$\frac12$$, so the second term of $$E[X_i]^2 = (\frac12)^2$$. For the first term, we note that $$X_i$$ takes on the values of $$0, 1$$ or $$2$$. This means that $$X_i^2$$ takes on one of the values from the set $$\{0^2, 1^2, 2^2\} = \{0, 1, 4\}$$. </p>
