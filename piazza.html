	<p>hi im just a little bit confused on the difference between the set &#39;belongs to&#39; another set and the set is a &#39;subset&#39; of another set</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>so the &#39;belongs to&#39; for a set is only referring to one element and whether that element is present in the set,</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>while for the &#39;subset&#39; part it is when you consider a whole set and see if that whole set is within another set?</p>
	<p></p>
	<p></p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>Your definition for &#34;belongs to&#34; is correct.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>One way of thinking about &#34;subset&#34; is &#34;A is a subset of B if every element of A is also an element of B&#34;. So for example, if $$A = \{1, 2\}$$ and $$B = \{1, 2, 3\}$$, then $$A \subseteq B$$, because every element of A is also an element of B. But if $$A = \{1, 4\}$$ and $$B = \{1, 2, 3\}$$ then $$A \nsubseteq B$$</p>

	<p>Response Time: 0:01:38</p>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>ok that makes sense, i know for the set itself order does not matter, so for something to be considered a subset that order does not matter either as long as the elements are in the whole set</p>
	</article>
	<article class="question">
	<p>correct. So in my example, we can say $$\{1, 2\} \subseteq \{1, 2, 3\}$$ but it is also true that $$\{2, 1\} \subseteq \{1, 2, 3\}$$</p>

	<article class="question">
	<p>Currently, I&#39;m trying to explore possible ways to solve this question with the 2^9 = 512 hint in mind. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>One avenue is powerset (P(S) with cardinality defined as 2^n), though I&#39;m not sure what using that would mean. The subsets would be all the possible combinations of elements in S. I thought about setting up the nine TAs as the nine elements, but that doesn&#39;t seem particularly useful.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>The other option I&#39;m juggling at the moment is more of a Step 1, Step 2, etc. based approach like the one we saw in lecture on Thursday. I originally thought of constructing a binary tree (9 rounds and two options per round - faulty fork or no faulty fork which would&#39;ve come out to 512 total permutations). I quickly realized this also makes no sense (it&#39;s redundant - why do the 8 other TAs need to check the fork if TA #1 already determined its status?). </p>

	<p>Title: Procedure that&#39;s not multiplication rule</p>
	<article class="question">
	<p>In the Lecture example: &#34;How many odd numbers between 1000 and 9999 have distinct digits?&#34; </p>
	<p>why does the multiplication rule still apply? For example, the number of ways performing step 4 depends upon whether a zero was chosen in the earlier steps.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Also in the president, secretary, treasurer question, the solution says multiplication rule does not apply because outcome of prior step changes later # outcomes. What&#39;s the logic that distinguishes the approaches to these two questions? </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Is it that within a question with multiple ways of performing the steps, only one sequence of steps allows multiplication rule to be applied and other sequences of events do not? thank you.</p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>Note that only Attempt 3 shows a correct solution for the &#34;odd numbers&#34; question. In that attempt, we can see that we will not select the number zero in steps 1 and 2. Only the second digit and the third digit can be zeroes, which is why they are placed last in our ordering of steps. But these steps also acknowledge the fact that, for example, the second digit cannot be the same as the first or fourth digit (whose digits have already been chosen), which is why there are 10 - 2 = 8 ways to perform step 3. And similar logic holds for step 4.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>I&#39;m not sure I completely understand your second question, but I&#39;ll try my best to give some information that may clear things up. Steps within your process that you develop for counting CAN depend on each other, but we can only perform MR when each step has a CONSTANT number of ways of being performed. For example, in attempt 1 of the &#34;secretary&#34; question, the third step can be performed in 2 ways if, for example, Bob is President and Ann is Treasurer, 1 way if, for example, Bob is president and Clyde is secretary, or 0 ways if, for example, Clyde is president and Dan is secretary. Since this is NOT a constant value, the MR can&#39;t really be used.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Whereas, in attempt 2, since we chose the secretary first, the remaining two steps always have the same constant number of people to choose from.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>For your last question, no. There can be many ways of ordering the steps. You just need to be sure that the ordering of the steps meets the above rule of that constant value for each step.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>hope that made a bit of sense!</p>

	<p>No, we can&#39;t quite say that $$k > 1$$ because it overlooks the case where $$x = 2$$. Since $$2 \in A$$, it can be possible that we let $$x = 2$$, and in this case, we would have $$k = 1$$. </p>

Or do all 59 shades together have 12 disjoint pairs of lipsticks (but then I&#39;m not sure why we would need to know the number of shades)? And for each disjoint pair, does &#34;disjoint&#34; imply that all the variants of green and orange are unique / do not repeat across the pairs? Do the variants have any connection to the number of shades? </p>
	</article>

	<p>You can think of it as there are 59 lipsticks, each a different shade. Within the 59, there are 12 disjoint pairs that satisfy the criteria. </p>

	<article class="question">
	<p>When disproving universal claims via counterexample, if I &#34;guessed and checked&#34; and found a counterexample out of luck/intuition, is it fine to say that I happened to find a counterexample, which disproved the claim? Or should I still resort to breaking down the claim into basic parts? (Example: the claim is that all (odd &#43; even) yields even integers. if I just try 3 &#43; 6 = 9, I have already found a counterexample. but I don&#39;t know if &#34;guessing and checking&#34; is a rigorous purpose for finding the counterexample, so should I go further and rewrite odd &#43; even with their definitions (2k &#43; 1) and (2m) and show how you always get an odd integer from 2(k &#43; m) &#43; 1, hence breaking the claim into basic parts?)</p>
	<p></p>

	<p>Title: Solution using a graph</p>
	<article class="question">
	<p>This might be an odd question, but if I find it easiest to prove a statement using a graph, could I put a graph on the PDF and use that? It wouldn&#39;t be logically or mathematically incorrect but I&#39;m not sure it would be accepted.</p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	Since we have not covered graphs in class, we advise you to avoid using graphs. <div><br /></div><div>If you choose to do so, you would be required to do a ton of proofs and provide immense justification regarding the graph, which is just overall very unpleasant.</div><div><br /></div><div>For that reason, we encourage you to stick to concepts that have been covered in class.</div>

	<p>Hi, </p>

	<p>Question: How many strings are there of four lowercase letters that have the letter x in them? </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Thanks, </p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>$$26^4 - 25^4$$ is the correct answer.</p>
	</article>
	<p>Response Time: 0:06:21</p>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>The lecture notes said the answer should be 4 x 26^3.</p>
	</article>
	<article class="question">
	<p>That solution is meant to be the one referenced by the &#34;Incorrect Solution&#34; note.</p>
	</article>
	<article class="question">
	<p>Ahh! Thanks!</p>
	</article>
	<article class="question">
	<p>Can you explain why 4 · 26^3 is incorrect? </p>
	</article>
	<article class="question">
	<p>Sure. The procedure to get this answer is as follows:</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Step 1: Choose one spot to place the x</p>
	<p>Step 2: Choose a letter for one of the remaining spots</p>
	<p>Step 3: Choose a letter for one of the remaining spots</p>
	<p>Step 4: Choose a letter for the last available spot.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Let&#39;s consider two <strong>distinct</strong> &#34;paths&#34; through this procedure.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Suppose in step 1, I place the x in the first slot. Now, in step 2, let&#39;s suppose we are looking at the second slot, and suppose we happen to choose the letter x for that slot as well. In step 3, suppose we place a y in the third slot. And suppose in step 4, we place a z in the last slot. Then the string we have constructed is &#34;xxyz&#34;.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Now, suppose in step 1, I place the x in the <strong>second</strong> slot. Now, in step 2, we find an available slot and choose a letter for it. So suppose we look at the first slot and happen to choose the letter x. In step 3, suppose we place a y in the third slot. And suppose in step 4, we place a z in the last slot. Then the string we have constructed is again &#34;xxyz&#34;.<br /><br />So we see that we have constructed the same string twice by following <strong>distinct </strong>&#34;paths&#34; in the procedure. This is an indication that we have overcounted, and the answer is incorrect.</p>

	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>As an example, suppose three of the cars are called $$A$$, $$B$$ and $$C$$ (distinguishable), and suppose the three interests are called $$x$$, $$y$$, and $$z$$.</p>

	<p>Then one possible distribution of these cars would be $$A$$ to $$x$$, $$B$$ to $$y$$ and $$C$$ to $$z$$. But clearly, there are many more ways to distribute the cars.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>If, however, the cars were indistinguishable, then we could all give them the same name of $$A$$. And the <span style="text-decoration:underline">only</span> way to distribute the cars now would be $$A$$ to $$x$$, $$A$$ to $$y$$ and $$A$$ to $$z$$. </p>

	<p>Contestant 2 gets a car: 8 possibilites</p>
	<p>Contestant 3 gets a car: 8 possibilites</p>

	<p>Contestant 1 gets 0 cars: 8^2 possibilites</p>
	<p>Contestant 2 gets 0 cars: 8^2 possibilites</p>
	<p>Contestant 3 gets 0 cars: 8^2 possibilites</p>

	<p>Contestant 1 gets all cars: 1 possibility</p>
	<p>Contestant 2 gets all cars: 1 possibility</p>
	<p>Contestant 3 gets all cars: 1 possibility</p>

	<p>I thought this was an error because for the next part, the solution goes &#34;Thus x \subseteq Y and hence X \subseteq Y. I&#39;m sorry if the solutions are actually correct and I don&#39;t get it.</p>

	<article class="question">
	In Q3, how do I make sure that the ordering of cars, ordering of contestants, and placing of the dividers are independent steps? Is that guaranteed by the symmetry of the tree of possibilities (i.e. for each x, there are y number of ways and for each of that way there are z number of ways)? If so, can we use that as our justification in in the hw? thanks.
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>I&#39;m not really sure what you mean by &#34;dividers&#34;, but regardless, it seems like you are already far along in your thought process for this problem, so it may be a better idea to visit office hours to discuss that thought process with a TA in person.

	<p>Hi, I read @202, and just wanted to confirm for Q6 on HW2H that a closed form expression is required as an answer for full credit. I know the post says that closed form is the default, but it also says that a reminder would usually be included for cases where an open form solution is viable and it seems like for Q6 an open form solution at the very least may <em>seem </em>viable based on the potential summation of a number of elements dependent on <em>n</em>.</p>

	<article class="question">
	<p>Hi! I have an approach for question 2 that I&#39;m not so sure about. I&#39;m pretty much representing a three-way venn diagram as sets. For example, let set A contain only silver dresses, set B contains only silver/tan dresses, set E contains only silver/tan/red dresses, and set D contains only silver/red dresses. Each of these sets can be empty. Then, let set S represent sets that contain tan dresses, so that S = {A, B, D, E}. Is this rigorous enough to go through the questions and do actual operations on?</p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>These Venn Diagram-esque approaches are good for gaining insight into what the sets will look like after the operations are performed on them, but do not suffice as a rigorous proof. For this, it may be a good idea to reference the lecture notes to see what a more rigorous proof would look like.</p>

	<p>If we are going to use a permutation or combination, are we required to write out the steps (step 1, step 2 etc.) to rederive what a permutation or combination is?

	If that is not enough, you are probably on the wrong track. You don't have to consider too much about this...
	
	If you need more you can generate them with this python code:
	
	```python
	from math import sin, cos, radians
	from turtle import Turtle, done, tracer, update
	
	turtle = Turtle()
	radius = 300
	sides = 10
	
	def init():
		tracer(0, 0)
		turtle.speed(0)
		turtle.hideturtle()
		turtle.penup()
		turtle.pensize(5)
		turtle.goto(0,-radius)
		turtle.pendown()
		turtle.circle(radius)
		turtle.penup()
		turtle.pensize(10/sides)
	def get_points(x):
		angles = [2**(-_)*360 for _ in range(x)]
		return [(sin(_)*radius,
				 cos(_)*radius)
				for _ in angles]
	def draw_line(point1,point2):
		turtle.penup()
		turtle.goto(*point1)
		turtle.pendown()
		turtle.goto(*point2)
		turtle.penup()
	def draw_lines(x):
		points = get_points(x)
		for point1 in points:
			for point2 in points:
				if point1 != point2:
					draw_line(point1, point2)
	def main():
		init()
		draw_lines(sides)
		update()
		done()
	
	main()
	```

	<article class="question">
	How does this word influence how we do counting?
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>Let&#39;s consider two similar questions:</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Question 1: How many ways are there to give two <strong>distinguishable</strong> watches to two distinguishable people such that each person gets a watch.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Solution: Let $$A$$ be the first watch and $$B$$ be the second watch. Let $$X$$ be the first person and let $$Y$$ be the second person. Then we have two distributions: $$((A, X), (B, Y))$$ and $$((A, Y), (B, X)$$. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Question 2: How many ways are there to give two <strong>indistinguishable </strong>watches to two distinguishable people such that each person gets a watch.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Solution: Now, we <strong>cannot</strong> call our watches $$A$$ and $$B$$ because they are indistinguishable. Instead, we will call them both $$A$$. If our people are $$X$$ and $$Y$$, then we only have one distribution: $$((A, X), (A, Y))$$. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>In a sense, &#34;distinguishable&#34; allows for more variety in our cases/distributions.</p>

	<p>Because $$a^2$$ and $$2b^2$$ represent the same number. Suppose we let $$p=a^2$$ and $$p = 2b^2$$, which follows from the fact that $$a^2 = 2b^2$$.

	<p>For my proof for Q2, I have shown that for every value of c, sqrt(a) is irrational. I am trying to state that proving this for every value of c is sufficient because every possible value that sqrt(a) can take on corresponds to a value of c. I am able to show that every possible value of a corresponds to a value of c, as a must necessarily be equal to 19c^2 for some value of c. Would I just be able to state that every possible value of sqrt(a) corresponds to some value a, to then transitively show that every possible value of sqrt(a) corresponds to some value of c, and thus showing that all values of c result in sqrt(a) being irrational is sufficient to show that all values of sqrt(a) are irrational? </p>

	<p>I&#39;m a bit confused by Q7 because it seems to me that parts a and b are asking the same thing.

So isn&#39;t the solutions for parts a and b the same or am I missing something? </p>

	<article class="answer">
	<p>In part a, the creatures in Max&#39;s list can be identical to that of Justin&#39;s list. But in part b, this cannot happen since Max must have at least one more.</p>

	<p>Title: Multiset Question</p>
	<article class="question">
	<p>This is more related to lecture but I am confused about this phrase in the lecture notes: </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>&#34;In other words, we want to find the number of ways there are to choose a multiset of r elements from a multiset of n distinct elements with infinite copies of each of the n elements available&#34;</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>How are we choosing a multiset from another multiset? Can you provide an example if possible? Thanks. </p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>A multiset is defined to be a set where elements can repeat. So if we are looking at a multiset that has repeats, and we want to select a subset of items, sometimes we would want repeats in that subset (hence, we would want to obtain a multiset).</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>A good example is the book example in the lecture notes, where in our 6 book selection, we will have repeats. </p>
	</article>
	<p>Response Time: 0:29:49</p>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>In that example I don&#39;t understand intuitevly where 6&#43;3-1 is coming from. </p>
	</article>
	<article class="question">
	<p>To clarify, I am asking why it makes sense that there are 8 possible locations to place a divider? I am counting only 5 (a divider in between two crosses). </p>
	</article>
	<article class="question">
	<p>I think the best way to explain this is to consider an arrangement of sticks and crosses. So for example, let&#39;s look at **|*|***. Each &#34;section&#34; corresponds to a type of book (and there are three types of books). Each star represents a book (or rather, a count of the amount of books in the category). So the arrangement I provided says that there are 2 books of type 1, 1 book of type 2 and 3 books of type 3. A single arrangement of books can uniquely be represented by one of these strings.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>We need 6 &#34;crosses&#34; to represent the 6 books that we need, and we need (3-1) = 2 dividers, so that&#39;s why we have $$\binom{6 + 3 - 1}{6}$$</p>
	</article>
	<article class="question">
	<p>Sorry, but I am still confused about why intuitevly 8 choose 6 makes sense. We are trying to choose 6 books out of 8 of what? Why is it 8? Why are the dividers included in the total? </p>
	</article>
	<article class="question">
	<p>8 is the total amount of books and dividers needed. In order to uniquely describe a selection of books, you need a &#34;string&#34; similar to the one I provided **|*|***, where there are 6 crosses and 2 sticks. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Instead of thinking of the 6 as &#34;choosing 6 books&#34;, it may be helpful to think of it as you have 8 spaces (where you need to place books and dividers), and you are choosing the locations to put the books.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Notice that $$\binom{6 + 3 - 1}{6} = \binom{6 + 3 -1}{3 - 1}$$, so in a similar mindset, we could instead choose the locations for the dividers, and the books will go in the remaining spaces.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>We need to include the dividers, because otherwise, we have no separation of the books, because we would be treating all books as indistinguishable.</p>

	<p>Makes sense now, thank you!</p>

	<p>Title: Is this a valid proof by contradiction?</p>
	<article class="question">
	<p>Let&#39;s say the claim is <strong>t</strong><strong>he sum is even. </strong>If I want to prove the claim by contradiction, we assume that the sum is odd. If my contradiction is that I showed that the sum will be even (contradicting the assumption), is this considered proof by contradiction? Or is this redundant/unnecessary because I am simply proving that the sum is even directly? </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Basically, for a specific problem, I just think it&#39;s easier and clearer to understand if I prove a claim by initially assuming the opposite and thus everything that assumption implies. Then with those implications and the rest of the context of the problem show that the original claim is true. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Hopefully, my question is clear (I tried my best haha) and I can get some guidance! </p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>This really depends on the proof. Most of the times when doing contradiction, we end up contradicting something true that was given in the problem, though in some instances, you may end up contradicting what you assumed.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>If you find yourself often proving the opposite of what you assumed, then it may be best to just stick with a direct proof.</p>

	<p>Title: Solving Q5 without 1&#43;...&#43;n = n(n&#43;1)/2</p>
	<article class="question">
	<p>Are we supposed to solve Q5 not using the fact that the sum 1&#43;...&#43;n  is n(n&#43;1)/2? </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>I have proved both of these questions in high school, second after the first using the first as a lemma. Right now I tried to prove the second normally by induction without using the above-mentioned fact. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>As usual, I get to the step where I substitute the induction hypothesis and I have </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>(1&#43;2&#43;...&#43;k)^2 &#43; (k&#43;1)^3</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>I tried to show that it equals to (1&#43;2&#43;...&#43;k&#43;(k&#43;1))^2 algebraically for the last few hours but I can&#39;t do it. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Alternatively, If I use the lemma I get (k(k&#43;1)/2)^2 &#43;(k&#43;1)^3 and I know how to get the required form from there to finish the proof. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>So my question is, are we expected to figure it out algebraically somehow or are we expected to just prove the lemma first and then prove the main claim using the lemma here? </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>My reasoning was that as there is nothing in question about doing it via proving 1&#43;...&#43;n = n(n&#43;1)/2 first, we should be able to do it without using this fact, but now after 4h of trying I am not sure anymore...</p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	You are allowed to use the fact that 1&#43;2&#43;…&#43;n =n(n&#43;1)/2 without proof, but it is not required to use it

	<p>Title: WLOG and &#34;arbitrary but particular&#34;</p>
	<article class="question">
	<p>What is the different between saying &#34;without loss of generality&#34; and &#34;arbitrary but particular&#34;? When would we use each?</p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>&#34;Without loss of generality&#34; is commonly used when making a claim for some variables. For example, I would say something like &#34;suppose $$a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$$, and without loss of generality, let $$a < b$$&#34;. And then I would do whatever math needed. In the instance that $$b < a$$, I wouldn&#39;t have to do any math because the &#34;symmetric&#34; argument is covered with &#34;Without Loss of Generality&#34;. That is to say, we can&#39;t just be throwing around WLOG whenever we want. We should only use it when the argument truly is symmetric.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>&#34;Arbitrary but Particular&#34; is usually used when describing an element of a set. We use this to indicate that there is &#34;nothing special&#34; about the element, and the argument for that element will hold for all elements of the set.</p>

	<p>Our solutions for 3H are now posted on Canvas, so you can take a look at them now.</p>

	<p>But in general, you can try to simplify a complex statement. So for example, the &#34;if...then...&#34; statement in Q2 is quite complex, but it can be boiled down to: &#34;if there is no prime $$p$$ such that XYZ conditions hold, then $$m$$ is prime&#34;.</p>

	* Otherwise, the answer is some combinatorial expression that I haven't found yet but I'm pretty sure would break if $$k = 1$$.

	<article class="question">
	<md>Hi there! This question is more appropriate for office hours than here, but I waited in the office hours line for two hours today, and had to leave for a meeting, so I wasn't able to get help. Since I'm pretty stuck and there's no other way to get help before the homework is due, I'm asking here. I'm very sorry if that isn't okay. 
	
	For Q3, I'm trying to come up with the appropriate question. I can see that the right side can be used to either make a question about an m-multiset of the union of two disjoint sets of size m and n, or the number of permutations in a multiset with m of one element and n of another. However, I’m absolutely stuck on the left side. I can see that it's probably the summation of some kind of partitioned set and that it’s somewhat similar to the formula for the permutations of a multiset with infinite elements of a certain number of types, but other than that I’m lost.</md>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	yeah this is a question that is hard to answer on piazza and better suited for OH. My best advice is to determine how you want to do the partition, which may be derived from any special characteristics you find about the things you count on the RHS.<div><br /></div><div>It may also be helpful to note that the bottom part of the “choose” on the LHS is m-1 instead of the m on the RHS</div>

	<article class="question">
	<p>In the lecture note for the proof that n! &lt; n^n, the induction step goes from using an equal sign to a less than sign. Why can we do this? </p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	Because the induction hypothesis says that $$k! &lt; k^k$$. So we’re substituting that in, which means we can’t use equality since the IH doesn’t have equality

	<p>Title: Any tips for designing a combinatorial proof</p>
	<article class="question">
	<p>How does one make a good counting question that can be used for a combinatorial proof, and what are some useful techniques? I noticed that the question is usually made from the simpler side of the identity to be proven, and the more complicated side is derived from partitioning the choices by some sort of scheme.</p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>I&#39;m not the greatest at combo proofs, but I&#39;ll do my best to answer this and maybe another TA can provide their advice.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>The way I approach combo proofs is exactly what you outlined: I look at the easier side, and formulate a counting question based off of that.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>The &#34;harder&#34; side often requires a bit more creativity. There&#39;s usually some sort of system involved in counting the &#34;harder&#34; side, whether that be partitions or casework. It&#39;s also nice to do a bit of pattern recognition (like if I see a $$2^n$$ on the harder side, I might be thinking about subsets).</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Really, a lot of it comes down to practice and creativity in developing different methods of solving the same counting question.</p>

	When doing any kind of induction proof, the most important thing to think about is making sure your induction covers all the values for the variable(s) you are inducting on.  It can take some time to find the correct strategy and it can come in different forms, but as long you cover everything you&#39;ll get the points for it.

	<p>Title: Question 2 approach</p>
	<article class="question">
	<p>I&#39;ve tried using induction on n for q2 starting with the IH n=k of picking coefficients on some terms x^p and x^q as (k choose p)*5^k and (k choose q)*5^k where p and q are from 1 to k to have the same remainder in division by floor(k/2). But my issue with the induction step for k&#43;1, I am limited to analyzing the coefficients on x^p and x^q that I picked for the induction hypothesis, which doesn&#39;t have to be the case. The issue is that I just have to show that such coefficients exist anywhere in the polynomial, but I feel like induction is forcing me to carry over the previous choices of the coefficients to the next step.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Is induction the right way to go for this question? I&#39;m struggling to also make use of the floor division property algebraically.</p>

	<p>For induction hypothesis, why do we say &#34;for some k&#34; instead of say &#34;for any k&#34;?</p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>great question. I think this comes down to how induction is built upon the idea of proving $$P(k) \implies P(k+1) \quad \forall k$$. Since it&#39;s hard to prove that implication for all values of k, if we show the implication to be true for an arbitrary value of $$k$$, then we don&#39;t have to worry about proving it for all $$k$$, because we would have already shown that since $$k$$ was arbitrary.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Since $$k$$ is arbitrary, we say &#34;for some k&#34;, since we don&#39;t really know what $$k$$ is, but we just want it to be arbitrary.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>I can&#39;t quite put my finger on why &#34;for any k&#34; may be incorrect because I think there are valid arguments on both sides (for it to be logically acceptable or not). One such argument is that &#34;for any&#34; may be an implication of strong induction, but not in an accurate way. But one could also argue that &#34;for any k&#34; can mean the same thing as &#34;for some k&#34;</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Given this, my recommendation is to stick with convention and to just use &#34;for some k&#34;.</p>

	<p>Since $$q\geq1$$, $$p\mid P(p,q)$$, so $$P(p,q)=q!\cdot\tbinom{p}{q}$$ is a multiple of $$p$$. It must then be true that $$p\mid\tbinom{p}{q}$$, since the only prime factor of $$p$$ (which is $$p$$) cannot divide $$q!$$ when $$q\leq p-1$$. This is because prime $$p$$ shares no common prime factors with any integers less than $$p$$. Thus, for any prime $$p$$ and integer $$q$$ s.t. $$1\leq q\leq p-1$$, $$p\mid\tbinom{p}{q}$$.</p>

	<article class="question">
	<p>Suppose that we have nodes A, B, and C. A is one way to C, but C is one way to B and B is one way to A. If we ask &#34;Can we travel from C to A&#34; will the answer be yes (because we can go through B)?</p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>No. The answer will only be &#34;yes&#34; if there is a direct connection (i.e. you only need to take one walkway to get from the start location to the end location of the question)</p>

	<article class="question">
	<p>For Q3, does a dead end have 0 neighbors, or does there just need to be an edge connecting the two nodes and not necessarily the right direction between the two? For example, if S-&gt;T and U-&gt;T, does T have 0 neighbors (because there are no available walkways to leave section T) or does T have 2 neighbors (because there are 2 edges connecting S and T and T and U)?</p>

I&#39;m just a little lost on how to show that what is in the summation is an integer multiple of p.

	<p>showing that $$\binom{p}{j}$$ is a multiple of $$j$$ would not imply that the summand is a multiple of $$p$$.</p>

	<p>Instead, try showing that it is a multiple of $$p$$ if your goal is to rewrite it as $$k + 1 + pm + p(\text{other stuff})$$. Try expanding out the $$\binom{p}{j}$$ and use what you know about $$j$$ compared to $$p$$.</p>

	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>Basically the issue arises from Steps 1 and 2.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>In step 1, we can say that there are five options for the fourth digit (namely 0, 2, 4, 6, 8). But after that, we can&#39;t quite say that for step 2, in choosing the first digit, there are only 8 options. This is because, if the digit we chose in step 1 is 0, then we actually have 9 options for the first digit.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Since the amount of ways to perform a step is not constant based on previous steps, we would be unable to perform the multiplication rule following the same procedure outlined in Attempt 3.</p>

	<p>Not quite, because that would be implying that the total number of even numbers with distinct digits is the same as the total number of odd numbers with distinct digits, and using the logic I provided above, it doesn&#39;t seem like these two values should be equal. </p>

	<p>Title: Formal Definition of Rational Number</p>
	<article class="question">
	<p>Is it: Can be represented as a/b, where a is an int, and b is a non-zero int. Do they need to have no common factors? I know we used this definition sometimes with the fact that they have common factors, and sometimes without that fact.</p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>Yeah, the definition is that if $$x \in \mathbb{Q}$$, then $$\exists a \in \mathbb{Z}$$ and $$\exists b \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{0\}$$ such that $$x = \frac{a}{b}$$.</p>
	<p></p>

	<p>Not necessarily for &#34;less explaining&#34;, but more so because that was actually the thing we contradicted. So you might be asking yourself, &#34;when should I add this &#39;constraint&#39;&#34;, and my answer to that would probably be most of the time.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>This is because even though the definition with and without the constraint define the same term, without the constraint of $$a$$ and $$b$$ sharing no common factors, there are an infinite amount of choices for $$a$$ and $$b$$. Whereas, if we introduce the idea of $$a$$ and $$b$$ sharing no common factors, then there is only one such pair. </p>

	<article class="question">
	<p>I partitioned the number of sequences into:</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>S_1 (no 2&#39;s) = 5! ways, since all are unique</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>S_2 (one 2) = choose place for a 2 (5 choose 1), then choose remaining unique items (5!/(5-4)!) </p>

	<p></p>
	<p>But this could get tedious if we are working with a large number of items that have repetitions. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>I guess my question is, can I somehow work the standard way of permuting multisets into this like in the lecture 3H on multisets? The problem is that not every element needs to have a position on the string... the total number of positions on the string doesn&#39;t add up to the total multiplicity of all the elements.</p>

	<article class="answer">
	<p>yeah I think it&#39;s kind of hard to incorporate permuting multisets in this, because when we do those permutations, we have very few constraints. In this problem, we introduce a lot of constraints, and while it may be possible to incorporate these constraints by modifying how we permute the multisets, it gets (arguably) equally tedious.</p>

	<p>Casing, though sometimes tedious, is usually quite effective, so you shouldn&#39;t rule it out immediately!</p>

	<p>i also don&#39;t really understand the reasoning for there being only 1 way to order the numbers in step 2.... does non-decreasing imply strictly increasing?</p>

	If you take any sequence of numbers, there will only be way to order them such that the permutation is non-decreasing (this is not the same as strictly increasing).  To get the intuition, try ordering some numbers with repeats and see how many ways there are to make the order non-decreasing.

	<article class="question">
	<p>In the Binomial Theorem, the notes say that a and b must be real numbers. With the 2^n example, I used (2 &#43; 0)^n and expanded using the binomial theorem. However, I didn&#39;t get the same answer as the lecture notes. Is that a fault in my calculation or should this work? </p>
	<p></p>
	<p></p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>you can still use $$(2 + 0)^n$$, but you will arrive at something different than $$\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}$$, because when we did $$(1 + 1)^n$$, we were able to simplify nicely using the fact that $$1^m = 1$$ for any $$m$$, but we do not have that leverage when we do $$(2+0)^n$$.</p>

	<p>Response Time: 0:04:51</p>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>But if we do (2 &#43; 0)^n, we basically prove that 2^n = 0, which proves the claim false?</p>
	</article>
	<article class="question">
	<p>not quite. You get the following:</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>$$(2+0)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} 2^{n-k}0^k = \binom{n}{0} 2^{n-0}0^0 + \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k} 2^{n-k}0^k = 1 \cdot 2^n \cdot 1 + 0 = 2^n$$</p>

	<p>oh i guess because if m and n are 2 it doesnt really work anyways</p>

	<article class="question">
	<p>evenness and relatively prime are two different things. Evenness describes a single value, whereas &#34;relatively prime&#34; describes two numbers. You can have an even integer be a part of a relatively prime pair. For example $$4$$ is relatively prime to $$5$$. Also, $$6$$ is relatively prime to $$25$$, for example. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>The proof is enumerating all possibilities of the parities of m and n, but we skip over this particular case because of the assumption that $$m$$ and $$n$$ are relatively prime. It is impossible for $$m$$ and $$n$$ to both be even and both be relatively prime, because if both are even, then $$2 \mid m$$ and $$2 \mid n$$, but this would go against the definition of &#34;relatively prime&#34;.</p>

	<p>ok so 4 is relatively prime to 5 because it doesn&#39;t divide into 5 </p>

	<p>ohhhhh like you are saying 2 and 2 are not relatively prime because 2 divides evenly by 2</p>

	<p>but like 5 does not divide evenly by 4?</p>

	<article class="question">
	<p>Remember the definition of &#34;relatively prime&#34;: $$x$$ and $$y$$ are relatively prime if and only if they share no common factors other than $$1$$.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>So $$4$$ and $$5$$ are relatively prime, because the factors of $$4$$ are $$1, 2$$ and $$4$$, and the prime factors of $$5$$ are only $$1$$ and $$5$$. Since the only common factor of $$4$$ and $$5$$ is one, we conclude that they are relatively prime.</p>

	<p>The multiset with infinite copies is: {infinity * 1, infinity *2 ... infinity*25} ?</p>

	<p>I am unsure if my thinking is correct for this question.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>1. Here is my understanding: there are n distinct objects. Once within a bin, these objects are indistinguisble. We get the multiset: {n_1*B_1, n_2*B_2 ...n_k*B_k}. The bins are like categories containing a bunch of indistinguisble n_i objects. We are trying to find how many ways we can order all n objects. This is simply the permutation of the multiset, so we can use the formula we derived in L3H. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>2. For the formula being used in this problem--is this formula just the number of ways you can order elements of a multiset? Like if we had {a*2, b*3,c*4}, is this formula calculating the number of ways you can order a, b, and c (9!) and then dividing out the number of ways you can order the elements of type a, b, and c since they are indistinguisble (2!3!4!)? </p>

	<p>Can you explain why you are multiplying $$4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1$$? If it&#39;s because there are &#34;four options&#34; for the first slot, and &#34;three options&#34; for the second slot, and so on, then you should be dividing by $$4!$$ because you&#39;ve already fixed the last card to be the non-four-of-a-kind.</p>

	<p>Yeah dividing is totally okay, but only if you have actually considered all permutations of the five cards. In this case, you&#39;ve fixed the last card to be the non-four-of-a-kind, so you aren&#39;t able to divide by 5! since not all permutations have been considered.</p>

	<article class="question">
	<p>If you have something like P(A) U P(B) U P(C) U P(D) U P(E) U P(F) instead of writing out set operations on 6 terms can you break it down into P(A U B U C) U P(D U E U F) so u do two set operations on 3 terms and then one on 2 terms or is that not the same thing?</p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>What do you mean by P(A)? If you mean powerset, then no, because it is not true that $$P(A) \cup P(B) = P(A \cup B)$$ because $$\{a, b\} \in P(A \cup B)$$ but $$\{a, b\} \notin P(A) \cup P(B)$$</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>If $$P(A)$$ means something else, then it depends on what that &#34;something else&#34; is, which means you may not be able to safely break it down in the way you suggested.</p>

	<p>For the outcomes where $$w_1 = w_2 = i, i \in \{1, 2, 3\}$$, three things need to occur:</p>

	<p>Let&#39;s analyze the probability of each of these:</p>
	<ol><li>Since the prize is equally likely to be assigned to any of the doors, and there are $$3$$ doors, there is a $$1/3$$ chance of the prize being assigned to door $$i$$</li><li>Since the contestant is equally likely to choose any of the doors, and there are $$3$$ doors, there is a $$1/3$$ chance of the contestant choosing door $$i$$</li><li>The $$2$$ remaining doors both do not contain the prize, so the host can choose either of them. Since there are $$2$$ remaining doors and both have an equal chance of being chosen, there is a $$1/2$$ chance of the host choosing door $$j$$</li></ol>
	<p>How many outcomes are of this form? We can use multiplication rule:</p>

	<p>For the last question about deleting a leaf, how do we know that the leaf we&#39;re deleting is not a part of any other walks besides the one its deleted from, so that the graph remains connected?</p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>A leaf $$v$$, which has degree 1, can only be a part of path $$P$$ if one of $$P$$&#39;s endpoints is $$v$$. If otherwise, then suppose we have a path $$P'$$ where $$v$$ is within the path, but not one of the endpoints, then $$P' = ... - u - v - w - ....$$ which would mean that $$v$$ would have two neighbors, and hence degree 2 (contradiction).</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>So when we remove $$v$$, the only paths we lose are those that have endpoint $$v$$. But since $$T' = T \setminus \{v\}$$ has all vertices of $$T$$ except $$v$$, all paths between non-$$v$$ vertices in $$T$$ remain in $$T'$$, so it&#39;s connected.</p>

	<p>Title: n-m connected components</p>
	<article class="question">
	<p>We have proven that a graph will have at least n-m connected components. However, if n=m (like a triangle) then n-m=0, which means that a graph will have at least 0 connected components. What does this mean? What if m&gt;n, so n-m&lt;0? What does that mean then?</p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>That fact is basically saying if $$|V| = n$$ and $$|E| = m$$, then $$|CC| \geq n - m$$, where we use the notation $$|CC|$$ to denote the number of connected components.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>In the case when $$n = m$$, then you can conclude that a graph has at least $$0$$ connected components, which is not too groundbreaking of a conclusion. In general, this fact does not give us much information when $$m \geq n$$, because you can always construct a connected graph with $$n$$ vertices and $$m$$ edges when $$m \geq n$$, and such a connected graph would only have $$1$$ connected component. This fact is more useful when $$m < n$$.</p>

	<p>Does the definition of a leaf change depending on rooted trees vs normal trees?</p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>yeah I made a mistake in @1174. There exists some literature in which a leaf is defined as only having degree 1. But according to this class&#39;s lecture notes, &#34;A vertex of degree greater than 1 in a tree is called an internal vertex, <strong>otherwise it is called a leaf</strong>&#34;.</p>

	<p>Title: Question 6</p>
	<article class="question">
	<p>Question 6 asks us to prove that you can get from one store in A to another store in B if and only if you can get from any record store to any other record store. Isn&#39;t this just the definition of a connected graph? I&#39;m really confused about what this question is really asking, because it seems like by definition the claim is already satisfied.</p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>It&#39;s not just that &#34;you can get from one store in A to another store in B&#34;, but rather, &#34;you can get from one store in A to another store in B <strong>using a single road&#34;</strong>.</p>
	</article>
	<p>Response Time: 0:02:36</p>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>but doesn&#39;t that still follow from the definition of a connected graph? I&#39;m assuming a single road is equivalent to a single unique path</p>
	</article>
	<article class="question">
	<p>this depends on how you construct your graph.</p>
	</article>
	<article class="question">
	<p>so could you clarify a bit on what &#34;a single road&#34; means? does it mean it could be either an edge OR a path?</p>
	</article>
	<article class="question">
	<p>Again, this depends on how you construct your graph. If edges represent roads, then &#34;a single road&#34; would mean a single edge. </p>
	</article>
	<article class="question">
	<p>I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;m still a bit lost. If I chose to construct a road as a path instead of an edge, then wouldn&#39;t the proof automatically be satisfied? is there leeway in how paths/edges can be constructed? </p>

	<p>Conceptually why are the following not equal? Because don&#39;t they both result in picking p&#43;1 objects from n objects?</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>expression 1: (n choose p) * (n-p choose 1)</p>
	<p>expression 2: (n choose p&#43;1)</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>When I expanded both expressions out, they are not equal, but I&#39;m having a hard time understanding why this is the case.</p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>This overcounts. Consider the counting question: &#34;From $$n$$ distinct elements, choose $$p+1$$ of them&#34;. Expression 2 clearly answers this question. We would think that we could construct a counting procedure in that we &#34;select p elements&#34; in step one and then &#34;select 1&#34; in the second step. But this will overcount some cases.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>For example, suppose $$n = 4$$ and $$p = 2$$. And suppose our elements are $$\{A, B, C, D\}$$. Then we have to select $$p + 1 = 3$$ elements. So suppose in step one, where we select $$p = 2$$ elements, we choose $$A$$ and $$B$$. And suppose in step two, where we &#34;select one&#34; of the remaining, we select $$C$$. Then, our collection is $$\{A, B, C\}$$.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>But we could instead in step 1 select $$A$$ and $$C$$. And then in step $$2$$ we could select $$B$$, so our collection would be $$\{A, B, C\}$$. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>So we&#39;ve obtained the same collection in two different ways from the counting procedure which indicates that we overcounted.</p>

	<article class="question">
	<p>I was told by the OH TA that to determine independence of two random variables, a good approach is to find a counterexample. I know that P(X=x and Y=y) = P(X=x)P(Y=y) if independent, and I know how to find P(X=x), but I&#39;m really stuck on finding P(X=x and Y=y). If the two dresses are from the same store, in my mind that would be like tossing two separate coins (which should be independent). Do you have any tips to get me started on finding the intersection here? </p>

	<p>What do you mean the other probabilities? I know how to find P(X=x) and P(Y=y). But I don&#39;t have anything to go off of for P(X=x and Y=y)? The only thing I can think of doing for finding P(X=x and Y=y) is to multiply P(X=x)P(Y=y), but that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to determine. What&#39;s a better way of determining whether the independence condition holds? Since they&#39;re two different hoods, I don&#39;t see how they are correlated, so it intuitively makes sense to just do P(X=x)P(Y=y) but then we&#39;re just using the targeted result to prove the targeted result.</p>

	<article class="question">
	<p>for the graph coloring proof, is the claim that the graph is only (k&#43;1) colorable if the max degree is k?</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>for example if I drew an eulerian graph w/6 edges, the max degree is 2 but can be 2-colorable</p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>The claim is saying that if the max degree in a graph is $$k$$, then the graph <strong>can be </strong>colored using $$k+1$$ colors. This is not to say that this is the minimum number of colors needed to color the graph. </p>
	</article>
	<p>Response Time: 0:01:55</p>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>Thank you! Also to follow up, is the converse of this proof true?</p>
	</article>
	<article class="question">
	<p>Not quite. For example, let $$k = 3$$ and consider a graph with two vertices with a single edge between them. Then indeed, the graph can be colored using $$3 + 1 = 4$$ colors, but the max degree in the graph is not $$3$$. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>You then might be tempted to say something along the lines of &#34;If a graph can be colored using $$k+1$$ colors, then the max degree in the graph is <strong>at most </strong>k&#34;. But even that statement is false.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>For example, consider a star graph with one central vertex $u$, and a set of vertices $$B$$ such that $$|B| = 2k$$, and there are $$2k$$ edges in the graph of the form $$(b_i, u)$$. So basically, one edge for each vertex in $$B$$ which connects that vertex to $$u$$. This graph can be colored using $$2$$ colors (basically color $$u$$ blue and all vertices in $$B$$ red). So that would mean that $$k = 1$$. But indeed, the max degree in the graph is not $$k = 1$$, it is $$2k$$ and $$1 < 2k$$. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>tl;dr: no, it&#39;s not true, and there isn&#39;t much of any conclusion that you can make.</p>

	<article class="question">
	<p>I am not sure if I am understanding the question correctly. For example, if we have a connected graph of 3 vertices and there exists an edge if only they are friends with each other. So can&#39;t we have a graph that has a beginner node who is only friends with an intermediate node, and the intermediate node is friends with also the advanced node, making the graph 3-colorable? And in this graph it is not necessarily true the beginner node is adjacent to both an intermediate neighbor and an advanced neighbor, even though the graph is 3-colorable. Do we assume that there exists a beginner node whose degree is 2 in the graph?</p>

	<article class="answer">
	<p>The graph you provided in your example does not have $$\chi(G) = 3$$, it has $$\chi(G) = 2$$. Note that $$\chi(G)$$ represents the <strong>minimum</strong> number of colors needed to color $$G$$.</p>

	<p>(Example. Suppose that n people leave their hats at the hat check. If the hats are</p>
	<p>randomly returned what is the expected number of people that get their own hat back?)</p>
	<p>Why is E[X] = (n-1)!/(n)!    ?</p>
	<p>That means that probability that ith person gets the hat is 99/100 * 98/99 * 97/98...* 1 / 2 right? </p>

	<p>Thank you. </p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>Instead of thinking of $$\frac{(n-1)!}{n!}$$ being computed as the product of probabilities, it is probably better to think of it as being computed as $$\frac{|E_i|}{|\Omega|}$$. The sample space is all ways that the $$n$$ people can get their hats back which means $$|\Omega| = n!$$. The event $$E_i$$ is the event that the $$i$$th person gets their hat back.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>So you can think of $$|E_i|$$ as computing the amount of permutations of $$\{1, ..., n\}$$ where $$i$$ is in the $$i$$th spot. This can be done in $$(n-1)!$$ ways.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Thus, $$Pr[E_i] = \mathbb{E}[X_i]= \frac{(n-1)!}{n!}$$</p>

	<md>
	Hmm even I did induction on the HW, but I was thinking about something slightly different. Would this proof by contradiction work?
	
	Let the graph be $$G(V,E)$$, we want to prove that $$\exists g\in V s.t, \forall v\in V\setminus\{g\}, (g,v)\in E\lor ((g,u)\in E\land(u,v)\in E)$$. Assume for contradiction that $$\forall g\in V, \exists v\in V\setminus\{g\}, s.t, (g,v)\notin E\land \lnot ((g,u)\in E\land(u,v)\in E)$$.
	
	The assumption means that for all vertices in $$V$$, there exists a vertex that it has neither directly beaten nor indirectly beaten. Let $$g\in V$$ be arbitrary but particular. Let $$F_g$$ be the set of all vertices $$g$$ has beaten directly ($$x\in F_g\iff (g,x)\in E$$). 
	
	By the assumption, there is a vertex $$a\notin F_g$$. Since all vertices have edges going between them, $$(g,a)\notin E\implies (a,g)\in E\implies g\in F_a$$, where $$F\_a$$ is the set of all vertices $$a$$ beat directly ($$x\in F_a\iff (a,x)\in E$$). Moreover, by the assumption, no vertex that is in $$F_g$$ has beaten $$a$$ (because if $$x\in F_g\land (x,a)\in E$$, we would have that $$(g,x)\in E\land(x,a)\in E$$, which violates the assumption). If no vertex in $$F_g$$ has beaten $$a$$, that means $$a$$ has beaten all of them, so $$F_g\subset F_a$$. It is a proper subset as $$g\in F_a$$, and $$g\notin F_g$$ (clearly). Hence, we have that $$|F_a|>|F_g|$$.
	
	By the assumption, there is a vertex $$b\notin F\_a$$, so we can repeat this exact same process again and obtain $$|F_b|>|F_a|$$ 
	
	Since the assumption applies to all vertices, we can simply repeat this process again and again, and we would eventually go through all the vertices (if we cannot repeat this process for any one vertex, it would violate the assumption), and we would obtain that $$|F_g|<|F_a|<|F_b|<|F_c|...<|F_y|<...<|F_n|$$ (this inequality contains the $$'F'$$ sets for all vertices in $$V$$). This means that $$n$$ is the vertex that has beaten the most people directly, but by the assumption, there is a vertex $$y\notin F_n$$ that it has not beaten directly or indirectly, which means that we can repeat the above process with $$y$$, and get the inequality $$|F_n|<|F_y|$$. 
	This is a contradiction, as we now have that $$|F_y|<|F_n|<|F_y|$$, which means $$|F_y|<|F_y|$$.  Hence, the assumption is wrong, and the claim is proven.
	
	Would this be shorter or longer than induction? Also, if it doesn't work, then what changes would have to be made? </md>

	<p>I think this solution is basically same as the alternate solution provided below. The &#34;repeat the process again and again&#34; to obtain $$|F_g|<|F_a|<|F_b|<...<|F_n|$$ isn&#39;t my favorite, so I think it would be easier to say, &#34;Let $$g$$ be the vertex with the greatest outdegree,&#34; and continue with the first few paragraphs of your proof (excluding the last one, basically). This is basically what the alternate solution below does, and you know that there is a vertex with maximum outdegree because there are a finite number of vertices.</p>

	<article class="question">
	<p>In general, should we be using induction on the edges in a graph rather than the vertices, and if so why?</p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>What you induct on really depends on the problem. Also, both induction on edges and induction on vertices have their own separate issues, so it just depends.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>For example, inducting on vertices can sometimes be annoying because when you remove a vertex, you also have to remove all incident edges. But at the same time, inducting on vertices can be nice when you can guarantee existence of a specific type of vertex in a graph (i.e a leaf in a tree)</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>What&#39;s nice about edge induction is that when you remove an edge, you don&#39;t <em>have</em> to remove any vertices, but removing edges can disconnect the graph, and removing edges in general may not be as easy to generalize as removing vertices.</p>

	<p>Why are these solutions true?</p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>For c, $$Pr[B] = \frac{|B|}{|\Omega|} = \frac{|\Omega|}{|\Omega|} = 1$$. To deem if $$A$$ and $$B$$ are independent, we need to check if $$Pr[A] \cdot Pr[B] = Pr[A \cap B]$$.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>We have $$Pr[A] = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega} = \frac{3}{5}$$. And we have that $$A \cap B = \{a, b, c\}$$ so $$Pr[A \cap B] = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|\Omega|} = \frac{3}{5}$$. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>So since $$Pr[A] \cdot Pr[B] = \frac35 \cdot 1 = \frac35 = Pr[A \cap B]$$, we have that $$A$$ and $$B$$ are independent.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>For part d, &#34;pairwise independence&#34; means for any <strong>two </strong>events, they must be independent. You can verify independence in the same way as we did above. &#34;mutual independence&#34; means that for any <strong>subset</strong> of the events, the probability of their intersection must equal the product of the individual probabilities.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>You can see that $$Pr[A] = Pr[B] = Pr[C] = \frac12$$. And we have that $$A \cap B \cap C = \{b\}$$, Thus, since $$Pr[A \cap B \cap C] \neq Pr[A] \cdot Pr[B] \cdot Pr[C]$$, we can conclude that A, B, and C are not mutually independent.</p>

	<p>How do we know that an m-augmenting path is of odd length? </p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>An m-augmenting path must be of odd length. This is because an m-augmenting path <strong>is</strong> an m-alternating path. So if you consider an m-augmenting path that traverses the vertices in the following order: $$v_0, v_1, v_2, ..., v_{2k+1}$$, we have by definition that $$v_0$$ and $$v_{2k+1}$$ are unsaturated, which means that $$\{v_0, v_1\}$$ is not in the matching, but $$\{v_1, v_2\}$$ must be. And $$\{v_2, v_3\}$$ is not in the matching, but $$\{v_3, v_4\}$$ is. Note that in order for the endpoint of the path to be unsaturated, we need $$\{v_i, v_{i+1}\}$$ to not be in the matching (where $$v_{i+1}$$ is the endpoint), which means that (by our pattern), $$i+1$$ is odd. So that&#39;s why our vertices ended with $$v_{2k+1}$$, suggesting that our path is of odd length. </p>

	<p>Ya I got that but the definition has &#34;each vertex of $$G$$ appears exactly once&#34; but in a cycle the start and end vertex is same so it appears twice right which conrtadicts the definitions part saying &#34;exactly once&#34;</p>
	</article>
	<article class="question">
	<p>yeah it&#39;s one of those things where we don&#39;t feel like specifying &#34;each vertex of $$G$$ appears exactly once except for the vertex that you start and end at&#34; because it&#39;s just unnecessary extra wording. We sort of incorporate that into the definition implicitly by noting that we are talking about cycles. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Tangentially, if we are being super careful, we can note that the definition of a hamiltonian cycle mentions that it is a <em>cycle</em>. And the definition of a cycle is a <em>closed path. </em>And a closed path is a <em>path</em> in which the start vertex and end vertex are the same. So I suppose the &#34;issue&#34; stems from the definition of path or closed path. But again, we sort of take this stuff for granted with these definitions and implicitly include these &#34;edge conditions&#34; when defining other terms.</p>

	<article class="question">
	<p>Hi! Could someone help me understand how we justify concluding the bolded portion below? This is from problem 2, recitation 10. Thanks! </p>
	<p></p>
	<p><em>Thus, there must be n|A| edges from A to NG(A). We also know that each column in NG(A) has at most n edges back to A, meaning that there are at most n|NG(A)| edges from NG(A) to A. <strong>This means that n|A| ≤ n|NG(A)|</strong>.</em></p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>We&#39;re basically counting the number of edges that &#34;leave&#34; $$A$$ and enter $$N_G(A)$$. We first conclude that there must be $$n|A|$$ edges from $$A$$ to $$N_G(A)$$, but that can be upper bounded by the second sentence by shifting our focus to $$N_G(A)$$ and seeing that there are at most $$n|N_G(A)|$$ edges from $$N_G(A)$$ to $$A$$. Note that there must be the same amount of edges going from $$A$$ to $$N_G(A)$$ as there are going from $$N_G(A)$$ to $$A$$ (in fact, they are the same edges). Since we have <strong>at most</strong> that many edges, we have an upper bound, so composing the two results together, we get $$n|A| \leq n|N_G(A)|$$</p>

	<p>I&#39;m a bit confused about the definition of a Ramsey number; how can a complete graph be 2-colored? If every vertex has an edge from every other vertex, for say the example of R(3,3)&lt;=6, I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s possible for that graph to be 2-colored.</p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>Here, the term &#34;coloring&#34; just means that we are assigning colors to the edges without the constraint of edges incident to the same vertex having different colors. So the Ramsey number is saying if $$R(k, l) = n$$, then for <strong>any</strong> assignment of colors (either red or blue) to the edges of the complete graph on $$n$$ vertices, you can find a red clique of size $$k$$ or a blue clique of size $$l$$.</p>

	<p>Title: lecture 10h notes question</p>
	<article class="question">
	<p>Hello, </p>
	<p>I&#39;m looking over lecture notes to prepare for the final and I have a question about one of the examples. In lecture 10h, there is an example problem calculating the variance of the hat problem we did in lecture 9h. When we are calculating the variance, the problem calculates $$E[X^{2}]$$ as follows:</p>
	<p>$$E[X^{2}]= \sum_{i=1}^{n} E[X_{i}^{2}] + 2 \sum_{i<j}E[X_iX_j]$$</p>
	<p>Where $$X_{i}$$ is if the ith person gets their hat back. I&#39;m wondering why we split the one variable i into 2, i and j. Where does the second summation term come from? Thank you </p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>We defined indicators in such a way that $$X = X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n$$. So $$\mathbb{E}[X^2] = \mathbb{E}[(X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n)^2] = \mathbb{E}[(X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n)(X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n)] $$</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Multiply the two expressions to get: </p>
	<p>$$\mathbb{E}[X_1X_1 + X_1X_2 + ... + X_1X_n + X_2X_1 + X_2X_2 + .... + X_2X_n + ... + X_nX_1 + X_nX_2 + ... + X_nX_n]$$</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>We&#39;ll &#34;group together&#34; terms of the form $$X_iX_i$$, so we have:</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>$$\mathbb{E}[X_1X_1 + X_2X_2 + ... + X_nX_n + X_1X_2 + X_1X_3 + ... + X_nX_{n-1}]$$ (just rearranging the terms in a friendly way here).</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Use LOE: </p>
	<p>$$\mathbb{E}[X_1X_1] + \mathbb{E}[X_2X_2] + ... + \mathbb{E}[X_nX_n] + \mathbb{E}[X_1X_2] + \mathbb{E}[X_1X_3] + ... + \mathbb{E}[X_nX_{n-1}]$$</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>The first $$n$$ terms can be grouped into one summation, and the last terms will have their own summation:</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>$$\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{E}[X_iX_i] + \sum_{i \neq j, 1 \leq i, j \leq n} \mathbb{E}[X_iX_j]$$.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Finally, we can just rewrite some terms to match the expression:</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>$$\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{E}[X_i^2] + 2 \sum_{i < j} \mathbb{E}[X_iX_j]$$. Note that the bounds of $$i$$ and $$j$$ are held implicitly in the second summation.</p>

	<p>In the TR b, it says G has max degree of delta. Then chromatic number of G = delta &#43; 1</p>
	<p>How is this different from the lecture lemma &#34;graph with maximum degree at most k is k&#43;1 colorable&#34;?</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Here delta = k: max degree delta is within the bounds of &#34;at most k&#34;, so wouldn&#39;t that make the graph delta&#43;1 colorable? Thank you!</p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>The chromatic number refers to the <strong>minimum </strong>number of colors needed to color the graph. So while a graph with maximum degree $$\Delta$$ is $$\Delta + 1$$ colorable, there are some graphs with max degree $$\Delta$$ that can be colored in less than $$\Delta + 1$$ colors.</p>

	<p>Title: Proof by contradiction that in any planar graph the minimum degree is at most 5</p>
	<article class="question">
	<p>In class today, we proved that in any planar graph with $$n$$ vertices $$\delta(G) \leq 5$$ by assuming for contradiction. In class, we assumed that $$\delta(G) \geq 6$$, after which the proof follows as such:</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>          $$\sum_{v \in V}deg(v) \geq 6n$$, and so by handshake lemma $$2|E| = \sum_{v \in V}deg(v) \geq 6n$$. or that $$|E| \geq 3n$$.</p>
	<p>          Using the corollary proved in class that in a planar graph with at least 2 edges, $$|E| \leq 3|V| - 6$$, we have that $$3n \leq 3n - 6$$, or that $$0 \leq -6$$, a clear contradiction.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>However, if you assume for contradiction that $$\delta(G) > 5$$, we have the following:</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>          $$\sum_{v \in V}deg(v) > 5n$$, and so by handshake lemma $$2|E| = \sum_{v \in V}deg(v) > 5n$$. or that $$|E| > \frac{5n}{2}$$.</p>
	<p>          Using the corollary proved in class that in a planar graph with at least 2 edges, $$|E| \leq 3|V| - 6$$, we have that $$\frac{5n}{2} < 3n - 6$$, or that $$n > 12$$. This doesn&#39;t seem to be a contradiction.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Clearly, the proof doesn&#39;t follow when assuming $$\delta(G) > 5$$, so why does it work when assuming $$\delta(G) \leq 6$$ rather than $$\delta(G) > 5$$? </p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>It&#39;s mainly due to the strictness of the bound. While saying that $$\sum_{v \in V} deg(v) > 5n$$ is not false, the value of $$5n$$ is a weak lower bound. We can see this because (for non-trivial values of $$n$$) we would also be able to say $$\sum_{v \in V} deg(v) > 5n+1$$ or $$\sum_{v \in V} deg(v) > 5n + 2$$ and so on. And those claims would indeed be true. Since &#34;degree&#34; takes on an integer value, when considering the sum, it is best to lower bound by the absolute minimum value of the degree (that a vertex can have), which in this case is $$6$$. Then, we have a much stricter lower bound, which helps with the calculations</p>

	<article class="answer">
	<p>&#34;Maximal&#34; usually refers to something that cannot be extended. &#34;Maximum&#34; means the largest value for a particular quantity. When it comes to paths, a <em>maximal path</em> is a path that cannot be extended. For <em>maximum path</em>, let $$P$$ denote the set of paths in the graph. A path $$Q \in P$$ is said to be <em>a maximum path</em> if the length of $$Q$$ is greater than or equal to the length of $$R$$ for all $$R \in P$$. </p>

	<article class="question">

	<p></p>
	<p>(sum X_i) ^2 = sum (X_i)^2 &#43; sum_i sum_j X_i X_j</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>is this correct?</p>
	<p>Also, how do we find the amount of sums in the second part of the equation?</p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>$$(\sum_{i=1}^n X_i)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 + \sum_{1 \leq i, j \leq n, i \neq j} X_i X_j$$</p>

	<p>Or equivalently, $$\sum_{i = 1}^n X_i^2 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} X_iX_j$$. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>To calculate the number of terms in the second summation, let&#39;s view the first equation I provided. There are $$n$$ options for $$i$$. There are $$n-1$$ options for $$j$$ because we must have $$i \neq j$$. So the second summation has $$n \cdot (n-1)$$ terms.</p>

	<p>$$X_i$$ is an indicator that is $$1$$ when the $$i$$th bin is empty. In other words, for each of the $$n$$ balls, we want them to land in a bin other than bin $$n$$. Thus, for a given ball, there are $$n-1$$ &#34;good&#34; bins that it can fall into (we subtract 1 to <strong>remove</strong> bin i). There are $$n$$ total bins. So the probability that a single ball does not fall into bin $$i$$ is $$\frac{n-1}{n}$$. Use independence to see that the probability that <strong>all $$n$$ </strong>balls do not fall into bin $$i$$ is $$(\frac{n-1}{n})^n)$$. Thus, $$Pr[X_i = 1] = (\frac{n-1}{n})^n$$</p>

I&#39;m not sure how to reconcile this with the fact that the when the first person selects, they could have taken any number of music drives with their p, meaning there could be less than c options for Selena?

	<p>Title: Random question about planar graphs and 3D objects</p>
	<article class="question">
	<p>Can every 3D object that doesn&#39;t have any holes in it (nothing topologically equivalent to a donut or other things) be converted into a planar graph and likewise, can every planar graph be converted into a 3D representation. Every corner where at least 3 edges meet can be a vertex. I have tried a few examples and it seems to hold so far. Every tree would just be a sphere like object. The version of the handshake lemma where you sum up the degree of the faces also works for the objects. The reason why I specified that the object should have no holes is because there ends up being extra faces in the planar graph. The space inside the hole, which should be counted as the out side graph face, becomes an inner face, so the lemma doesn&#39;t work. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>I did try drawing the 3D equivalent of a k3,3 graph to see if it would break anything and I got this weird Mobius strip thing with twists that couldn&#39;t really be turned into an enclosed 3D object (I could have just drawn it wrong). I haven&#39;t tried doing it with a k5 graph, but I am assuming something similar will happen.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Anyone know anything about this or how one could prove something like this. </p>
	<p>(sorry if this was poorly explained)</p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>I think I&#39;ve heard something about planar graphs being related to a sphere in 3D space by triangulation. Haven&#39;t read up on this recently, but it might be something worthwhile to check out. I think I&#39;m just a little bit confused as to how you are translating the planar graph to 3D space. Can you go into the process of making the tree a &#34;sphere-like object&#34;.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>There are many other TAs that have better expertise in this subject than myself, so they may be able to chime in. If explaining it via text proves to be too difficult, I am holding office hours on Monday evening and would love for you to come by and explain this to me. </p>

	<p>The spherical shape is the only way to have the faces of the planar graph and the 3D object work. Since in a tree, there is only one face, it would translate to a object that only has 1 face. The edges of the tree would be sort of like a ridge, but since there is no cycle, this ridge doesn&#39;t fully wrap around the sphere. making two distinct faces. </p>
	</article>
	<article class="question">
	<p>Ah I see. I&#39;ve thought about this quite a bit and am leaning towards the idea that every flat-faced 3D shape that is topologically equivalent to a sphere can be represented as a planar graph. And the idea is basically to cast it as a net in 2-space. I think there is probably some logical extension to make this hold true for non-flat-faced 3D solids, but I think there are some edge cases to handle and/or specify how to handle them. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>The converse, however, seems to be much more difficult for me to conceptualize. I mostly think this because there is quite a bit of freedom in how you can transpose a 2-space figure into 3-space (admittedly, there is also quite a bit of freedom when reducing 3-space to 2-space, but I think in general, this transformation is a bit more constrained). I&#39;ll think about this some more though. Thank you for bringing up this question because it has been really fun to think about!</p>

	<p>Could I get some help on how this work was derived, especially the first two lines?</p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>The first line is using the law of total expectation. For the second line, we have that $$Pr[Y = 1] = p$$ because that is the probability of success on the first trial. In the case that the first trial was successful, we stop with the procedure, and we have $$X = 1$$. So that would mean $$E[X] = 1$$ and $$E[X^2] = 1$$. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>If the first trial was unsuccessful, then we have $$Y = 0$$, and this occurs with probability $$(1-p)$$. Then we &#34;ignore&#34; this trial, and consider the expected number of trials to get a success, but we add one for the failed trial that we just had, so we have $$E[X^2 | Y = 0] = E[(X+1)^2]$$. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Substitution of the above quantities gives the second line.</p>

	<article class="answer">
	<p>I know this was explained at some point, but could you explain again why it is (X&#43;1)^2 and not X^2 &#43; 1</p>
	</article>
	<article class="question">
	<p>We have $$E[ X^2 \mid  Y=0] = E[X\cdot X \mid Y=0]$$. By the memoryless property, $$E[X\mid Y=0] = E[X+1]$$, so $$E[X\cdot X \mid Y=0] = E[(X+1)(X+1)]$$.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>More intuitively, we want to &#34;add 1&#34; to the number of trials we have to perform, and the thing we are squaring is the &#34;number of trials&#34;.</p>

	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>Because $$p$$ is defined to be the smallest prime factor of $$n$$. Since $$q_1$$ and $$q_2$$ are also both prime factors of $$n$$, we must have $$q_1 \geq p$$ and $$q_2 \geq p$$. So then $$q_1 \cdot q_2 \cdot m \geq p \cdot p \cdot m = p^2 \cdot m$$</p>

	<p>How are we getting that Var[H] is simply 100 x 0.5 x 0.5? I thought we had to break H up into indicators (Hi = 1 if the ith roll returns heads) and do a summation of the squared terms and the paired terms.</p>

	<article class="answer">
	<p>$$H$$ is a binomial random variable and the variance of a binomial random variable $$X$$ is given by $$Var[X] = np(1-p)$$. So in the context of the problem we have $$n = 100$$ trials, and $$p = \frac12 = 0.5$$</p>

	<p>Title: Review Q8</p>
	<article class="question">
	<p>How is Pr[n=k] always 1/11? Because there is no replacement, isn&#39;t Pr[n=1] = 1/11, Pr[n=2] = 2/10, Pr[n=3] = 3/9, etc.? </p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	<p>$$Pr[n=2]$$ can be calculating the probability that you do not get the candy bar you like on the first trial multiplied with the probability that you get it on the second trial. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>There is a $$\frac{10}{11}$$ chance of not getting the candy bar you like on the first trial. After this, the candy bar you have received has run out in the vending machine, so there are only 10 candy bars left, one of which is your favorite. So the probability that you get your favorite candy bar on the second trial is $$\frac{1}{10}$$. So we have $$Pr[n=2] = \frac{10}{11} \cdot \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{11}$$.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>You can use this same process for all values of $$k$$, and see that it is always true that $$Pr[n = k] = \frac{1}{11}$$.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Another way of arguing the probability is by considering the sample space being permutations of the candy bars. The event of interest is that the candy bar you like is in the $$k$$th position. The cardinality of the sample space is $$11!$$. The cardinality of the event set is $$1 \cdot (11-1)! = 10!$$. So the probability of the event is $$\frac{10!}{11!} = \frac{1}{11}$$</p>

	<p>Title: Irrationality Proof</p>
	<article class="question">
	<p>Hi,</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>How would we go about the proof that root 40 is irrational using the argument p|ab implies p|a or p|b.</p>
	</article>
	<article class="answer">
	Yeah I think following the proof format of how we proved $$\sqrt{2}$$ is irrational for this problem would be kind of tough (mostly because the multiplicity of 2 in 40’s prime factorization is not 1). The way I would go about proving this is noting that $$\sqrt{40 = 2\sqrt{10}$$ and then showing that $$\sqrt{10} is irrational (which is easier to do). Finally you can conclude that an irrational multiplied with a non-zero rational is irrational.
