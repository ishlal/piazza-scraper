Remember, to show equality, we show inclusion in both directions. So focusing on the direction $$(A \\setminus B) \\cup (A \\cap B) \\subseteq A$$, we would want to show that for any element that appears in the left hand side, it must also appear in the right hand side. 2.sp2 argues that for any element $$x \\in (A \\setminus B) \\cup (A \\cap B)$$, we have $$x \\in A$$, so we have that any element in the left hand side also appears in the right hand side (since x was arbitrary), and by definition of subset, we conclude that the left hand side is a subset of the right hand side.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We then go on to show the inclusion in the other direction. And to show that, we would go about taking an arbitrary element of $$A$$ and show that it appears in $$(A \\setminus B) \\cup (A \\cap B)$$.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I think the key thing to note is the definition of subset. We have $$A \\subset B$$ if and only if for every element $$a \\in A$$, we also have $$a \\in B$$.

Equivalently, this counts the number of subsets of size $$r$$ from our original set.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Stars and bars can be thought of as a two step procedure. We see a direct correlation between distributing indistinguishable items to distinguishable containers with an arrangement of stars and bars. So to count the number of ways to distribute, we count the number of arrangements of stars and bars. Suppose we have $$n$$ stars and $$r-1$$ bars, then our procedure would begin by choosing $$n$$ locations to put the stars. Since the remaining open slots\u00a0<strong>must</strong> be filled with bars, they can only be filled in one way. So by MR, you get the familiar equation for stars and bars which is $$\\binom{n + r - 1}{n}$$, or equivalently, $$\\binom{n+r-1}{r-1}$$</p>\n"}

{"input_text": "QUESTION: Why are we solving for when we are returning the ith pair of sock? How does this lead us to find the expected pair of socks\n", "output_text": "ANSWER: <p>The total amount of socks being returned can be thought of as a sum of a bunch of $$1$$&#39;s and $$0$$&#39;s, where a 1 indicates if the sock has been returned and a 0 otherwise. For example, suppose we put in 3 pairs of socks (we&#39;ll label these pairs A, B, and C) and only received 2 back. And further, suppose that we didn&#39;t receive pair B back. Then, it is true that we received 1 &#43; 0 &#43; 1 = 2 pairs back (1 for A and 1 for C). This is essentially what indicators are. So if we were to define an indicator for each pair of socks, and sum them all together, we would get the total amount of pairs returned.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus, if $$S = I_1 + I_2 + ... + I_n$$, then $$\\mathbb{E}[S] = \\mathbb{E}[I_1 + I_2 + ... + I_n]$$. And by using Linearity of Expectation, we have this being equal to $$\\mathbb{E}[I_1] + \\mathbb{E}[I_2] + ... + \\mathbb{E}[I_n] = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{E}[I_i]$$.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So our problem has been reduced to finding the expected value of an indicator, where the indicator is whether or not the $$i$$th pair is returned. By finding this value, we can easily obtain $$\\mathbb{E}[S]$$ using the math above.</p>\n"}
