QUESTION: In question 2 on HW1T, should we explain why the expression is or isn&#39;t a tautology? Is the truth table enough to justify the claim? Thank you!
ANSWER: A one sentence justification would be nice

QUESTION: <p>When we submit files/solutions for homeworks and quizzes, do we have unlimited resubmissions until the deadline where the latest submission is graded?</p>
<p></p>
<p>I saw &#34;If you submit multiple solutions for a problem, only the first one will be graded&#34; in the policy guidelines, but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s talking about submitting homework files multiple times or just having multiple solutions to a single proof within a homework. Thanks.</p>
ANSWER: <p>yes to the first question.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The second paragraph holds true for a single proof within a homework.</p>

QUESTION: Is it possible for there to be multiple answers to a question, specifically in question 3? If so, should we list all of them?
ANSWER: If you believe a question has multiple solutions, then you should list out all solutions

QUESTION: Are the midterm 1 and 2 dates certain yet? 
ANSWER: We will announce them soon!

QUESTION: <p>Is it okay to insert &#34;s.t.&#34; within statements a, b, and c in problem 3? For example, there are like three &#34;chunks&#34; in each statement and I think there are certain places between said chunks that could benefit from a &#34;s.t.&#34;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I feel like it would make the statements flow a little better when reading them and (if im not mistaken?) it wouldn&#39;t change the meaning of any of the statements</p>
ANSWER: yes

<p>When I try to register for office hours through the OHQ link, it shows this. What should I do? Can I come into office hours regardless since the link is not working for me?</p>
ANSWER: Yes, you should show up to the Office Hours room and let a TA know that you are having trouble joining. They will help you out.

QUESTION: What does it mean to explain briefly but rigorously why the statement is<br />true?
ANSWER: After you determine the quantifiers needed, you should explain why the overall statement is true with rigor. You are free to use words/math to convince the proof reader why the statement is correct/true.

QUESTION: After rereading the policies on collaboration, I couldn&#39;t quite ascertain if asking anyone for help on LaTeX is allowed. Could I get some clarification about the specifics of the collaboration policies on this or a link to the relevant part of the website?
ANSWER: <p>In short, a behavior is against course policies if you are obtaining outside help for the problem solving and proof writing process outside of TAs/professor.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can interpret &#34;asking for LaTeX help&#34; as asking someone, for example, &#34;do you know how to write the $$\exists$$ symbol in LaTeX?&#34;</p>

QUESTION: 
ANSWER: There isn&#39;t a full-fledged syllabus written out. But you can amalgamate information from the course website to get most of the information you need. If you have specific questions, feel free to ask the professor or email the course account.

QUESTION: Quick question to clarify on course policy surrounding LaTeX; I understand that collaboration is strictly prohibited for homework assignments, but is it acceptable to consult outside sources (say LaTeX information online, or asking friends for LaTeX and not homework help specifically)? Thanks in advance.
ANSWER: This is fine

QUESTION: For Question #2, do we determine whether expression a) and b) are tautologies ( a) = b) )? Would there then have to be two separate tables with the last column evaluating the entire expression?
ANSWER: No. You need to determine if the expression in part a is a tautology, and same for b. They are independent questions

QUESTION: Does the order of quantifiers matter? Reading a proposition, there seems to be a logical difference between $$\forall q \in \mathbb{Z}$$ $$\exists r \in \mathbb{Z}$$ P(x,y) and $$\exists q \in \mathbb{Z}$$ $$\forall r \in \mathbb{Z}$$ P(x,y). The first one seems to state that for all integers q, there exists an integer n to satisfy the proposition. In contrast, the second one seems to state there exists an integer q that satisfies the proposition for all integers r. Am I overthinking the significance of the order quantifiers appear?
ANSWER: This is something I want you to think about further on your own! Try coming up with some examples of a proposition, and see how it changes meaning.

QUESTION: In question 3, part a) and part b), is there a difference between the &#34;Z&#34; and &#34;N&#34; domain? If so, what?
ANSWER: Yes. $$\mathbb Z$$ is the set of all integers (positive, zero, and negative).<div><br /></div><div>$$\mathbb N$$ is the set of all natural numbers (0, 1, 2, …)</div>

QUESTION: What is the difference between the negation operator and the not operator? In problem 1, if we want to write out &#34;The CIS 1600 TAs do not all watch movies during office hours&#34;, should we be using the negation sign or the not sign for the statement r?
ANSWER: &#34;negation&#34; and &#34;not&#34; are the same

QUESTION: In-person lecture notes and the posted lecture notes seem to use different symbols for negation and implication sign. Would both the single and double arrows be accepted, and for negation, would just the line on top of letters be marked correct?
ANSWER: <p>$$\lnot p$$ and $$\overline{p}$$ are equivalent and mean the same thing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\implies$$ is usually preferred for implication, but we typically handwrite $$\rightarrow$$ for convenience. You won&#39;t get points off for using $$\rightarrow$$.</p>

QUESTION: When making truth table, does the order of columns matter?
ANSWER: Nope

QUESTION: For #2, would something like &#34;Because the final column (final column containing the original expression) is all true, this expression is a tautology&#34; be sufficient for explanation? Also, what is meant by filling out the entire table?
ANSWER: <p>first question: yeah that&#39;s fine.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Second question: Every blank cell must be filled in with some value (T or F)</p>

QUESTION: Can I attend a recitation I am not registered for? The recitation I want to attend is currently full.
ANSWER: Yes, please email the TAs of the recitation you wish to attend as well as the recitation you are currently a part of and let them know that you will be attending a different one. For official registration, you will have to take care of that on PathAtPenn (i.e. make sure you are signed up for some recitation).

QUESTION: For Homework 1T, non-Latex answers are accepted but will any points be deducted?
ANSWER: no

QUESTION: The instructions for qs 3 say to &#34;Write the resulting statement in both logical notation and plain English&#34;. for logical notation is that just replacing the question mark with the universal or existential quantifier? 
ANSWER: yes

QUESTION: How important are parentheses and/or scoping in a proposition? Is it needed? Will points be taken off if parentheses are not used? 
ANSWER: points will not be taken off for omitting parentheses. They are not required, but can help with organization.

QUESTION: I completed and submitted my assignment in overleaf, but I didn&#39;t see the template provided until after I finished and submitted the homework, so my formatting isn&#39;t exactly the same as the template. Is this something that would result in a grade penalty? (I will use the template going forward.)
ANSWER: it&#39;s fine for this homework, but you should use the template in future hws otherwise you may lose points

QUESTION: Hi, for this assignment I chose to do the homework on my iPad using a note-taking app. When I create a pdf, it just creates a long one-paged pdf, so there aren&#39;t really page numbers. Would I be penalized if I just stated that each problem was on the same page when uploading?
ANSWER: Nah that’s fine

QUESTION: On part b of 1.3 on the policy quiz, it asks whether asking people for LaTeX help is ok. There&#39;s no place on the collaboration policy summary where I see this discussed. As long as homework is never discussed, is it ok to ask for tech help with LaTeX? 
ANSWER: yes

QUESTION: I was in OH and was told that when proving &#34;there exists,&#34; writing examples with specific numbers works. When proving &#34;for all,&#34; writing examples with general numbers (ie. using variables) works. Just wanted to verify if this is okay? Was told to ask on Piazza for extra confirmation. Thanks!
ANSWER: <p>This is something that we want you to think about further. What does it mean for something to &#34;exist&#34;? I&#39;ll give you a non-math example:</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#34;Prove that <em>there exists</em> a human on earth named Ishaan.&#34; </p>
<p></p>
<p>How would you prove this? Well, one way would be to just point to me, because I am a human on earth and my name is Ishaan.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But what if someone asked &#34;Prove that <em>for all </em>humans, each human has a name&#34;? Think about how you would go about proving that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, think about how all of the above applies to number and variables. Keep in mind that variables can take on <em>any</em> value.</p>

QUESTION: Hello!<br /><br />For question 3 on HW 1T, do we need more than the instructed logical notation, plain English, and brief explanation? I just don&#39;t know what else to write to make sure its &#34;carefully justified&#34;.
ANSWER: logical notation and an english explanation is fine.

QUESTION: For question 7 on the homework it says he slips in the bad barbie with the 508 other dolls. Does this mean there are 508 barbies total? Or 509?
ANSWER: 508 barbies total.

QUESTION: Is the 7|x at the end of question 1 (a) part 4 a typo? Does it mean 3x must be less than 57 and 7*|x| or 7*x?
ANSWER: it is not a type. The symbol $$\mid$$ reads as &#34;divides&#34;. So $$7 \mid x$$ reads as &#34;7 divides x&#34;

QUESTION: For problems q4 and q7, do we need to write out our intuition/thought process for how we came up with the correct strategy, or do we just need to give the strategy and explain why it works?
ANSWER: You can just provide the strategy and justify why it is a correct strategy.

QUESTION: Hi, I noticed that on Tuesday, lecture notes were posted on the cis 1600 website after the lecture was over. In general will Lecture notes be posted after the lecture is over? If so, when will today&#39;s lecture notes be posted? Thank you!

ANSWER: It is supposed to say &#34;How many Lovely Lavender presents are there&#34;

QUESTION: For Q3 on HW1H, what counts as a unique way to paint the physicists? ie. are RGBGR and GRBRG considered distinct or not. Also, do we need to consider the ordering of the physicists, or do we only need to consider the different sequences possible on a single set/unchanging line of physicists?
ANSWER: <p>RGBGR and GRBRG are considered distinct.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can assume that the physicists are already aligned for you.</p>

QUESTION: Is weird barbie distinguishable from the other barbies?
ANSWER: no

QUESTION: To clarify, how many circles does Barbie Rashmi make with the presents in Q5? Is it one big circle or several circles of varying sizes? Thanks!
ANSWER: one circle

QUESTION: I recall that in class today, Professor Rajiv said that $$\emptyset \subseteq S, \forall S$$, which makes sense. However, he also said that $$\emptyset \in S, \forall S$$, but I thought $$\in$$ compares an <em>element</em> to a set, and since the empty set is a set, wouldn&#39;t that make this second statement not true?
ANSWER: <p>R: He did not say both.  if I remember correctly he left it up to us students to determine on our own which one is correct.</p>
<p></p>
<p>no someone answered him and said that the second statement was true, and he said yes and for us to think about it to understand why.</p>
<p></p>
<p>R: He definitely mentioned the $$\in$$ being for elements in the lecture, but I&#39;m pretty sure he didn&#39;t say that the 2nd was true.... but I could be wrong</p>
<p></p>

QUESTION: <p>Am I able to use logical operators in set notation such as:</p>

QUESTION: For HW 1H Question 6, is it asking how many different combinations of dollhouses Thomas Li-eynman can bring back in one trip or is it asking how many ways can Thomas Li-eynman bring back all 33 dollhouses in up to 33 trips? 
ANSWER: the former

QUESTION: If we solved Q3 using two different procedures, would you add or multiply the # of outcomes from both procedures together to get the final number of outcomes?
ANSWER: Depends on what the procedures are. Think about <em>when </em>you use the addition rule versus the multiplication rule. Remember what requirements/conditions are involved in multiplying values.<br /><br />EDIT: I feel like providing a <em>hint</em> may be more beneficial for the population. Addition is useful when cases/procedures are disjoint.

QUESTION: Can you use integer ceilings/floors in q3?
ANSWER: sure

QUESTION: This might be a dumb question, but the question says that someone playing with the doll will lose their fingers/toes at exactly 1:59 pm. So does that mean that afterward and before the Weird Barbie is a regular Barbie and is no longer a problem since she wouldn&#39;t be dangerous anymore? Or is the time an extraneous detail we shouldn&#39;t worry about in considering our strategy
ANSWER: You can think of the Weird Barbie as always being dangerous. The thing about the 1:59 detail is that someone who played with the weird barbie will only know they have done so at 1:59 (because that’s when their fingers and toes fall off). But this is helpful because it will allow Oppen-erren to not sell the weird barbie, because he will have a minute to figure it out.

QUESTION: If the physicists are all wearing the same color, is this also considered symmetric? I was confused about the wording &#34;symmetric about the middle of the n physicists&#34;.
ANSWER: Yes that would also be considered symmetric

QUESTION: What is the difference between a proper subset and a subset? Is it just that for a proper subset to exist, the set in which the subset is included has to have some element that is not part of the subset? Also, are the notations different?
ANSWER: <p>We say that $$A$$ &#34;is a subset&#34; of $$X$$, written $$A \subseteq X$$, if $$\forall a \in A$$ we have $$a \in X$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We say that $$A$$ &#34;is a <strong>proper</strong> subset&#34; of $$X$$, written $$A \subset X$$, if $$\forall a \in A$$ we have $$A \in X$$ <strong>and </strong>$$A \neq X$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In English, they are very similar, except proper subset insists that the Left Hand Side set is <em><strong>not the same</strong></em><em> </em>as the Right Hand Side set.</p>

QUESTION: <p>For this question, what is the degree of the variability in the the bags&#39; weights? For example, can it be as extreme as one bag weighing more than all the other 199 bags combined?</p>

QUESTION: <p>While doing the hw especially number 5, I was wondering how much rigor the assignment demand</p>
<p></p>
<p>Is it enough to provide an argument that the average logical person would be convinced (a logically correct argument with no holes)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Or is a formal proof needed</p>
<p></p>
<p>if so how much are we allowed to assume</p>
<p></p>
<p>Are we allowed to make assumptions for results that are trivial like</p>
<p>$$A \subseteq B \implies |A| \leq |B|$$</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>$$ A \subseteq B \subseteq A \implies A = B $$</p>
<p></p>
ANSWER: Neither of those assumptions are trivial. You should prove everything that has not been given to you already.

QUESTION: Does a successful strategy have to work for arbitrary weights and arbitrary arrangements of the weights? Also, do we assume Megan selects optimally?
ANSWER: Yes, no

QUESTION: For the question, it does not specify if the physicists next to each other should all be wearing different colors and colors can not be repeated except for the symmetric part. Is that true or can the physicists have repeat of colors? For example Red Red Orange Red Red. I solved the question assuming that they can not repeat colors like Red Orange Yellow Orange Red. Is that okay?
ANSWER: Colors can be repeated

QUESTION: Are we allowed to watch YouTube videos for further understanding of topics?
ANSWER: I would advise against it. Mostly because concepts taught in this class are often taught differently elsewhere, and learning from a source that teaches the concepts slightly different would not be beneficial in the long run

QUESTION: Hello, who are the instructors for the office hours on Monday and would I email them a zoom link directly about the problems? Also, how long is office hours on Monday?

QUESTION: Should I consider the presents in question 5 to be alternating or should i consider them as spacing between the pink presents?
ANSWER: this is something we&#39;d like you to think about

QUESTION: For question 3, is it the case that all the physicists on the left side have to wear different colors. For example, would it be valid if all physicists wore red? I&#39;m unsure if the physicists can repeat colors on one side of the symmetry?
ANSWER: Colors can repeat. It would be valid if all physicists wore red

QUESTION: During the Thursday lecture, Professor Gandhi revised the formula for the number of subsets of S (equivalent to the cardinality of the superset of S) a few times. The lecture notes state that the formula is $$2^n$$. However, I believe he also mentioned $$2^{n-1}$$ for a certain case. Which formula should we note as the &#34;correct&#34; formula? Thank you!
ANSWER: $$2^n -1$$ is the number of proper subsets. It is also the number of non-empty subsets.<div><br /></div><div>$$2^{n-1}$$ is the number of subsets that contain a fixed element</div>

QUESTION: <p>I was thinking of using a binary assignment for all barbies in Q7 where the 1s indicate that the tester plays with a certain barbie and the 0s indicate they don&#39;t. Each barbie could have a unique binary assignment this way. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Is this an intuitive solution? I don&#39;t need to know if it&#39;s right or wrong. I am confused because while it sounds logical, it doesn&#39;t employ any logic mechanisms we studied in class thus far.</p>
ANSWER: You can use binary if you want. But you must always justify your answer

QUESTION: I&#39;m using <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.tablesgenerator.com/#</a> to generate tables in LaTex – but it doesn&#39;t seem to fit in the \solution{} environment, and instead the table places itself above. Is there an easy fix for this?
ANSWER: maybe try removing the <code>\begin{table}</code> and <code>\end{table}</code> that the website provides. Instead try to use <code>\begin{tabular} </code>and <code>\end{tabular}</code> only.

QUESTION: for 7/x can the answer be a fraction when we plug in an integer for x(i.e. x = 14 and 3(14) &lt; 57 and 7/14 = 1/2?
ANSWER: The symbol $$\mid$$ does not represent division. It reads as &#34;divides&#34;. So $$7 \mid x$$ reads as &#34;$$7$$ divides $$x$$&#34;.

QUESTION: So the weird Barbie is indistinguishable from other Barbies, but can we assume that the testers are keeping track of which Barbie is which? ie. they have some way to number their barbies even assuming they&#39;re all normal

QUESTION: For Q4, since the question only asks to provide a strategy, is it also necessary to provide a rigorous proof for why the strategy works?
ANSWER: yes, you should justify your strategy

QUESTION: I am still confused about whats&#39; expected for Q7. Theoretically, is it not enough to simply ask one Barbie tester to play with all the dolls before Sep 4th, and then when he/she looses fingers, pick out and remove the weird barbie? 
ANSWER: <p>But how would we identify which one is the weird barbie with this strategy?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Also remember that tester’s fingers don’t fall out immediately after playing with the weird barbie, but only at exactly 1:59 PM, see @92</p>

<p></p>
<p>I want it like this:</p>
<p>S1 choose # of ways for 1st person to enter</p>
ANSWER: it could be because you are still in math mode. make sure you have dollar signs surrounding anything that is math, and no dollar signs around text. LaTeX does not like when text is in math mode.

<p></p>
<p>For the second question, there are a couple things to keep in mind:</p>
<p>First, there are usually many ways to solve a problem, so information that may be helpful to one solution may not be pertinent to another solution.

QUESTION: <p>For my hw i want to prove the statement  </p>
<p></p>
<p>$$A \subseteq B \implies |A| \leq |B|$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>But for this I need to use some sort of rigorous definition for cardinality </p>

ANSWER: no

QUESTION: <p>While proving, when do we use contrapositives vs. contradictions?</p>
<p>It would be great if you could explain using an example. Thanks!</p>
ANSWER: <p>Both of these techniques are pretty similar and often both can be used on a question. I&#39;ll give you an example to show how <em>both </em>proof approaches could work.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Prove: for a positive integer $$x$$, if $$x$$ is even, then $$x + 2$$ is even. </em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p>Contradiction: Suppose that $$x + 2$$ is not even. Then, $$x + 2$$ is odd, so we have $$x + 2 = 2k + 1 $$ for some $$k \in \mathbb Z$$. Then, $$x = 2k + 1 - 2 = 2k - 1 = 2(k-1) + 1$$. Since $$k-1 \in \mathbb Z$$, we have that $$x$$ is odd, which is a contradiction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Contrapositive: Our contrapositive statement is: If $$x + 2$$ is odd, then $$x$$ is odd. Well, if $$x + 2$$ is odd, then $$x + 2 = 2k + 1$$ for some $$k \in \mathbb Z$$. Then, $$x = 2k + 1 - 2 = 2(k-1) + 1$$ and since $$k-1 \in \mathbb Z$$, then $$x$$ is odd and our contrapositive statement is proved.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can see that in both proofs, we are doing very similar things. With contradiction, we are essentially <em>adding </em>a new assumption (in the above case, assuming that $$x+2$$ is odd), and our goal is to contradict one of our assumptions. In contrapositive, we are starting with a new hypothesis in a sense and working in the opposite direction. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Contrapositive works when we have an &#34;If... then...&#34; statement (as these words imply implication). But contradiction may also work too.</p>

QUESTION: In order to disprove a proposition, is finding a counterexample enough? or should we provide a mathematical justification? Or both?
ANSWER: You can disprove a universal claim with a counterexample

QUESTION: for q3a, do we have to prove every number we talk about is prime / composite, or can we assume that its common knowledge that numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7 are prime and numbers like 4, 6, 8 are composite?

QUESTION: In the lecture notes 2T, in the example on the first page for the proof of the following: &#34;Example. Prove that if 3n &#43; 2 is odd then n is odd,&#34; if we try to prove the contrapositive, are we solely trying to prove the contrapositive true? Thank you!
ANSWER: Yes. Remember that the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original implication. So proving the contrapositive also proves the normal forwards direction

QUESTION: Can we say that positive integers are the same as natural numbers?
ANSWER: No. Because 0 is a natural number but not a positive integer

QUESTION: is that an absolute value sign or does it mean floor? 
ANSWER: floor

QUESTION: For this question, are we allowed to assume that the square root expression refers only to the positive value of the square root (as in $$\sqrt{4} = \pm 2$$ and disregarding -2)?

QUESTION: <p>$$a+b<c$$ so $$a^2 + 2ab + b^2<c^2$$ where $$a+b>0$$ and $$c>0$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Was that an implication or is it already an equivalence by the rules of algebra (it&#39;s easy to see that we can take take the square root of both sides to arrive back to the first statement).</p>
ANSWER: a one sentence justification of why this is true would be nice

QUESTION: Can the above conclusion be used directly?
ANSWER: sureeeee

QUESTION: Can we assume that if both sides of an inequality are positive then we can square it while keeping the sign the same, or is this something that we need to prove?
ANSWER: You can utilize the fact that $$\forall x \in \mathbb R$$ we have $$x^2 \geq 0$$.

QUESTION: If a proof I want to reference is already written in the lecture notes, can I just say &#34;as proved in the lecture notes... such and such is true&#34;
ANSWER: yah

QUESTION: Can we claim that if i is an arbitrary but particular integer and that j is an arbitrary but particular integer, then i-j is an arbitrary but particular integer?
ANSWER: no, it is not really arbitrary since it is dependent on $$i$$ and $$j$$

QUESTION: Do we say &#34;let a belongs to A be an arbitrary but particular element of A&#34; or &#34;let a belongs to A be an arbitrary but particular element&#34;.
ANSWER: <p>either is fine</p>
<p></p>
<p>The way I would usually phrase it is as follows: &#34;Let $$a\in A$$ be abp&#34; or &#34;Fix some element $$a\in A$$&#34;</p>

QUESTION: If you have p&#43;10 and p&#43;11, can you say that one is even and one is odd since their difference is 1? Or do you have to prove why?
ANSWER: a one sentence justification would suffice

QUESTION: If you are using contradiction to prove a statement and come up with a statement that doesn&#39;t exactly negate one of the original statements but makes it ambiguous (Ex: given &#34;p is prime&#34; but you find that p could be either even or odd), would that still work as contradiction?
ANSWER: This is something we’d like you to think about

QUESTION: 
ANSWER: no

QUESTION: Title.
ANSWER: &#34;Without loss of generality&#34; is commonly used when making a claim for some variables. For example, I would say something like &#34;suppose $$a, b \in \mathbb Z$$, and without loss of generality, let  $$a < b$$&#34;. And then I would do whatever math needed. In the instance that $$b < a$$ I wouldn&#39;t have to do any math because the &#34;symmetric&#34; argument is covered with &#34;Without Loss of Generality&#34;. That is to say, we can&#39;t just be throwing around WLOG whenever we want. We should only use it when the argument truly is symmetric.

QUESTION: In the lecture notes, when proving if something is odd it says n = 2p &#43; 1 where p is an integer. Is it wrong if we replace it with: where p is a natural number?
ANSWER: Yes it is wrong, because then $$2p+1$$ will never be equal to -3, for example, and -3 is odd

QUESTION: In question 1, it is said that each TA chooses their favorite sport and belongs to that set. That seems to imply that any 2 sets of F, T, etc. are disjoint (because each persom presumably has 1 favorite). However, the statement in 1a just says that &#34;$T\cap F\cap S = \emptyset$, so should i not assume $F\cap T = \emptyset$ despite the problem description?
ANSWER: You should not assume that $$F \cap T = \emptyset$$.

QUESTION: HW_3H Q4 requires a &#34;combinatorial proof.&#34; I take this to mean that factorial expansion/manipulation of both sides is not sufficient, and we need to provide a hypothetical question answered by LHS and RHS. Is this correct, or can I simply do the algebra?
ANSWER: Correct. You should not be performing any algebra to manipulate any side of the equality. You should go through the process of posing a counting question and answering it in two different ways.

ANSWER: <p>Wait but the players are arranged in a line.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So for an arrangement of $$a, b, c, d$$, the pairs would be $$\{a, b\}, \{b, c\}, \{c, d\}$$</p>
<p></p>

QUESTION: Is the legendary silver trophy included in the k?  I thought it was included from the wording but I&#39;m guessing not because it seems like it&#39;d make the k=1 case impossible for anything but r=1
ANSWER: it is included in the $$k$$

QUESTION: Is Nathan only buying a certain amount of each color, or is he also then ordering them?  Also, does he have to buy the silver trophy?

<p></p>
<p>no to the second question</p>

QUESTION: If we do an inductive proof, is simplification of the RHS in Q2 allowed?  I know we&#39;re not supposed to manipulate both the LHS and RHS and meet in the middle, but if we know the RHS equals something else, without manipulating the LHS, could we substitute that something else in for the RHS and prove that expression?
ANSWER: Yes. You should be manipulating <em>only one side</em>. It doesn&#39;t matter which side, but just one side.

QUESTION: When we go to select pages for homework 3H in Gradescope, six questions are listed, but there are only five questions on the homework. Should we just ignore the extra question?

QUESTION: <p>Do we have to prove that if a&gt;b, then a(k)&#43;b(p) &lt; b(k&#43;p)?</p>
<p>also can we assume that if a&gt;b and c&gt;d, then ac&gt;bd?</p>
ANSWER: <p>No.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Edit: The statement &#34;if a&gt;b and c&gt;d, then ac&gt;bd&#34; is false. Consider $$-1 > -3$$ and $$-2 > -4$$.</p>

QUESTION: Since there are players numbered 1 through 99, are consecutive pairs even possible since there is an odd number of players, so the player on the end won&#39;t have a consecutive number?
ANSWER: For an arrangement of players $$a, b, c, d$$, the pairs are $$(a, b), (b, c), (c, d)$$

QUESTION: Can we assume that the players are arranged in numerical order?
ANSWER: No

QUESTION: Do we need to prove that an odd sum can only be the result of one even and one odd integer? Or can we cite that we proved this in recitation

ANSWER: for $$k \in \mathbb N$$, you can assume this

QUESTION: I just want to confirm I have this correct: the problem is asking for the number of ways for Rashmi, Elisa, and Harish to contribute $900 collectively to the trip (in $20 increments), and each of them have $900 left in their savings (also in $20 bills)?
ANSWER: That&#39;s mostly correct except for the fact of them having $900 &#34;left&#34;. They will start out with having $900 left because they are each contributing $100, but then they need to contribute more to reach the $1200 goal.

QUESTION: Do we need to write out the calculations of our sample numbers once we&#39;ve already found our counting question? For example, if we&#39;re writing a question for n choose k, do we need to write out how we calculated a value for n choose k given n=20 and k =6?
ANSWER: You shouldn&#39;t be using specific values anywhere in a combo proof. The counting question you pose should be in terms of the variables presented in the equality.

QUESTION: <p>Would we need to prove this statement in our proof?</p>
<p></p>
<p>(2 &#43; 3)^k &lt; (2 *3)^k</p>
ANSWER: no

QUESTION: <p>In Q3, previous instructors have responded that silver is always a color Nathan can choose from, even when k=1. However, that would mean for r&gt;1, Nathan is unable to choose any more trophies, as there only exist one trophy of one color he can choose from.</p>
<p>Thus, for k=1, does that mean r must also equal 1?</p>
ANSWER: sure, for $$k = 1$$ you can assume that $$r = 1$$

QUESTION: <p>can i just say that $$\frac{k^4+6k^3+13k^2+12k+4}{4}=\left(\frac{k^2+3k+2}{2}\right)^2$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>or do i have to somehow show why</p>
ANSWER: you don&#39;t have to justify this simplification

QUESTION: Not sure with the new restriction on closed form, but can we say that the summation of cubed positive integers from 1 to n = (1)^3 &#43; (2)^3 &#43; ... &#43; (n)^3., then manipulate that in the induction step to solve for the proof?
ANSWER: you could. Closed form only really applies to your final answer (if a question asks for some numerical answer)

QUESTION: Do we have to prove ((k&#43;1)(k&#43;2) / 2) ^2 = summation (i = 1 to k&#43;1) i^3?
ANSWER: You should make a justification (or maybe even a citation...) of how this simplification is made

QUESTION: <p>Q1 says, &#34;Answer the following questions. No justification is necessary; however, if your answer is incorrect, you may receive some partial credit for nearly correct justification&#34;.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Does this mean I can just input the final answer without any explanation?</p>
ANSWER: Yep, but if the answer is wrong you will likely receive 0 credit

QUESTION: When proving the induction and we cite the Induction Hypothesis within the Induction Step, can we manipulate both sides of the induction hypothesis?
ANSWER: you should not

QUESTION: Can we just directly use the sticks and crosses formula, namely \binom{n&#43;r-1}{r}, by stating &#34;according to sticks and crosses method, there are \binom{n&#43;r-1}{r} ways to..&#34; ?
ANSWER: yeah but you definitely should define what your sticks are and what your crosses are in context of the problem

QUESTION: For Question 1, we get full credit as long as the answer is correct right? No justification needed.
ANSWER: Yuhh

QUESTION: Title!
ANSWER: <p>Adding two outcomes works best when we perform &#34;casework&#34;. That is, when solving a problem, we decide to break it down into smaller sub-problems (by perhaps casing on a constraint) and then adding all the values together to get a final value. Addition works when our casework is <em>disjoint</em> -- that is, no situation appears in multiple cases. You may also notice that adding (aka the addition rule) is essentially a corollary of PIE. In case this isn&#39;t clear, most problems that ask for a numeric answer can be considered as finding the cardinality of some set. Call this set $$A$$. Suppose we decompose the set $$A$$ into subsets $$A_1, A_2, A_3$$. Then, we want to find $$|A| = |A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3|$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>using PIE, we have $$|A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3| = |A_1| + |A_2| + |A_3| - |A_1 \cap A_2|  - |A_1 \cap A_3| - |A_2 \cap A_3| + |A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3|$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Admittedly, this does not really look like the addition rule, but more often than not, we define $$A_1, A_2, A_3$$ in such a way that they are disjoint. That is, $$A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset$$. With this, a lot of terms in the PIE are equal to 0 and we are left with $$|A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3| = |A_1| + |A_2| + |A_3|$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>TL;DR: If we decompose our problem into sub-problems that are disjoint, then we typically use the addition rule.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As for multiplication rule, this is often used for a multi-step procedure. That is, instead of decomposing a problem into separate smaller problems that must be solved &#34;in whole&#34;, we instead decompose a problem into a step-by-step procedure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The difference now is that we are looking at &#34;all cases&#34; to be considered and breaking down a procedure whereas for addition, we were looking at &#34;some cases&#34; at a time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When you have a procedure, you can consider the amount of ways to perform each step. If the amount of ways to perform each step is <strong>constant</strong> regardless of how the prior steps were performed, then you can use the multiplication rule to find the total amount of ways the procedure can be carried out.</p>

QUESTION: <md>Can the TAs contribute $0 after contributing the initial $100, or does it has to be at least a $20 increment?</md>
ANSWER: They can contribute 0

QUESTION: For Q1, would n = 2 go up to just 1 &#43; 1/4, or would it be 1 &#43; 1/4 &#43; 1/9...&#43; 1/2^2?

<p>I understand how they got the cardinality of S1 and S2 and that they can be added to arrive at the final answer. However, I do not get how 2^k &#43; 2^k = 2^(k&#43;1). I might be missing something else in the proof, though.</p>
ANSWER: $$2^k + 2^k = 2 \cdot 2^k = 2^{k+1}$$

QUESTION: does it matter if we put the base case before the hypothesis? if so when does it matter?

ANSWER:  this is something we&#39;d like you to think about

QUESTION: When you are doing the induction step before you use the induction hypothesis, must you write the IS expression in terms of the IH expression. For example before I can substitue in 1 &#43; 1/4 ... 1/k^2 and make it 1 &#43; 1/4 ... 1/k^2 &#43; 1/(k&#43;1)^2, do I have to write 1/(k&#43;1)^2 in terms of 1/k^2
ANSWER: You should reduce your IS to some form of the IH and then substitute it in. That is, it should be relatively clear where you are substituting the IH in.

QUESTION: For Homework #1, do we have to prove 2 - 1/(k&#43;1) is equal to (2k^3 &#43; 3k^2 &#43;k) / (k(k&#43;1)^2 (show work)?
ANSWER: That’s a non-trivial simplification, so yes you should show work

QUESTION: Do we need to prove that if a&gt;b, then for any number r we know r-a&lt;r-b?
ANSWER: Is this true?

QUESTION: Title! Sorry just double checking my algebra
ANSWER: Like kinda? There is a big argument in the world of PEMDAS. Some would argue that Addition and Subtraction are on the same tier and should be applied in a left-to-right order. Others argue that Addition should take precedence over subtraction. So if in doubt, add parentheses when you can. <div><br /></div><div>In this case, if the prior steps follow logically, we would be able to say that this is equivalent</div>

QUESTION: Can we make the jump to representing the LHS as a summation using sigma or do we have to prove why sigma notation can be used?

QUESTION: Does it matter specifically which TA in the pair &#34;takes&#34; a picture? e.g. if TA #2 took a picture with TA #1, would TA #2 and TA #1 each have taken one picture (thus taking the same amount of pictures) or does it only count as a picture for TA #2?
ANSWER: that picture would contribute for both TAs&#39; counts. So TA#1 and TA#2 would each have taken one picture

QUESTION: When the questions says &#34;designer at each corner will be the same,&#34; does that mean that the designer will be the same at all 4 corners of the rectangle or just one?
ANSWER: Same designer at all 4 corners

QUESTION: Does beating a supreme outfit make an outfit supreme? The statement of the problem suggests it doesn’t, as it might entail beating a separate outfit by 2 degrees of separation, but the problem says it’s only supreme if it beats an outfit directly/with 1 DOS
ANSWER: this is something you should think about. Try drawing out some examples to see if your observation is correct.

QUESTION: I am a little confused on how to start the induction because we seem to have two unknown variables (n days and some number of friends that is undefined). How do I start approaching this? Does my base case set n to 1 as well as the number of friends to 1? 
ANSWER: for questions like this, we encourage you to attend Office Hours to speak with a TA face-to-face

QUESTION: The problem statement asks us to &#34;Help Jason determine the best outfits and prove that at least one of the n outfits will be a Supreme Outfit.&#34; Does this mean that if we prove the existence of the Supreme Outfit x_i, we must also identify a method to find the Supreme Outfit?
ANSWER: You just need to prove the existence of the Supreme outfit. 

QUESTION: <p>To clarify what qualifies as a Supreme Outfit: if we had three outfits where A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A, would all three be considered Supreme Outfits?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Add-on: if we had four outfits, and A beats B, B beats C, and C beats D, would A also be considered a Supreme Outfit?</p>
ANSWER: <p>Yes to the first question.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the second question, not necessarily, because all battles haven&#39;t been written out. We can&#39;t conclude if A is supreme because we do not know if it directly beat D or if it indirectly beat D yet. There isn&#39;t enough information that you have provided.</p>

QUESTION: <p>In this case: A beats B beats C beats D beats A. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Can we still consider A to be the supreme? </p>
ANSWER: @457

QUESTION: Can we use PIE in anyway in this question?

QUESTION: <md>I was confused if we can make assumptions of a set condition in PHP.

ex)

Say that I have 8 red balls and 8 blue balls. If I were to put them in 15 different bags, I would know that by GPHP that there exists at least one bag with at least $$\lceil \frac{16}{15} \rceil = 2$$  balls in it. Say that if I were to do so, I can only have two balls of different colors in the same bag. Does this change anything about the condition in the generalized pigeon hole principle? Can I still state that there will be two balls of different color in the same bag, given that the bag has at least two balls in it?</md>
ANSWER: You do not know that the bag that has at least 2 balls in it has two balls of different color. Consider the case where all red balls go into bag 1 and all blue balls go into bag 2. We indeed have a bag with at least two balls in it, but there does not exist a bag that has balls of different colors

QUESTION: <md>By "total number of friends" and "the sum of the number of friends attending each day", is the following the same statement as described in the question?

> The total number of *unique* friends who attended the fashion show is at most the sum of the number of friends attending each day

Say that on day one we had A, B and C coming and on day two we have A and C coming. Then is the claim that # of unique friends (3) < # of total visits from friends (5)?</md>
ANSWER: yes

QUESTION: In order to be a supreme outfit, does it need to beat all the other outfits directly and indirectly, or does it only need to be one other outfit directly and indirectly?
ANSWER: the former

QUESTION: If I have four outfits, A,B,C,D, if A beats B, B beats C, C beats D, D beats A, does that mean I have four supreme outfits?
ANSWER: It is unclear, as we do not know the results of A vs. C and B vs. D

ANSWER: Thank you for informing us. We are in the process of resolving this situation

QUESTION: Is it possible that the HW grade can be curved? I feel like this homework is way more challenging the the previous ones. 
ANSWER: We do not curve individual homework assignments. However, the professor <em>may</em> choose to curve the class at the end of the semester.

QUESTION: Title. 
ANSWER: you must prove anything that was not covered in class

QUESTION: If two distinct coefficients both have a remainder of 0, does that prove our claim?  Does it have to be a nonzero remainder?
ANSWER: Any remainder is fine. It need not be non-zero

QUESTION: <md>Should I prove the following statement, or can I assume it?

>  For all arbitrary but particular integer $$s$$ such that $$s \geq 1$$, if we divide any positive integer with $$s$$, then there exists exactly $$s - 1$$ unique remainders the division will yield.</md>
ANSWER: A one sentence justification would suffice

QUESTION: <p>The question says that k ∈ Z and k &gt;= 3. Is one of these supposed to be x instead of k?</p>
<p></p>
ANSWER: No, it’s supposed to be k

QUESTION: Do I have to prove that $$\left \lfloor \frac{k}{3} \right \rfloor < \left \lceil \frac{k}{2} \right \rceil+1$$ for k&gt;=3, or is a small justification enough?
ANSWER: Small justification is desired

QUESTION: <p>I noticed in class all of the induction proofs have had a minimum such that $$n\geq 0$$ or some other number, without an upward bound. I was wondering if we could use induction on numbers with a maximum st $$n\leq p$$, where $$p \in \mathbb{Z}$$. In that case would we work backward, starting at the top and proving that anything less that $$k$$ is valid? </p>
<p></p>
ANSWER: This is something we want you to think about. Take a look at HW5T Q3c!

QUESTION: Are we allowed to do a combinatorial proof for Q2? Or are we supposed to do an inductive proof. 
ANSWER: You can use any proof technique you want. Any correct and logically coherent solution will receive credit

QUESTION: <p>Does the definition of induction as used in this class allow for induction step with $$n=k-1$$ working backwards, is it ok to refer to this as &#34;induction&#34;?</p>
<p></p>
ANSWER: @500

QUESTION: Do we have to prove that remainders must be less than the divisor?
ANSWER: nope

QUESTION: Does the presence of more than 1 base case mean strong induction?
ANSWER: <p>Not necessarily. You can still do multiple base cases and do ordinary induction (where the base cases are just extra insurance).</p>
<p></p>
<p>In another direction, when doing strong induction, you will almost always have more than 1 base case.</p>

QUESTION: Can we assume that the definitions of Fibonacci numbers (e.g. F(j &#43; 2) = Fj &#43; F(j &#43; 1)) holds for all positive integers j?
ANSWER: Yes, that is provided as a given

QUESTION: are we supposed to use a specific proof method like induction for Q2? or would a direct proof suffice?
ANSWER: Any proof technique is fine and will receive credit if it is correct and logically coherent

QUESTION: Does the hint in #1 mean we can assume that every coefficient is unique (i.e., n!/r! = n!/(n-r)! would not apply?). If not, can someone clarify? Thanks!
ANSWER: <p>The hint means that the value of $$\binom{n}{m}$$ will be different from $$\binom{n}{l}$$ so long as two conditions hold:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1) $$l \neq m$$ and $$l \neq n-m$$</p>
<p>2) $$1 \leq l \leq n$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>What you choose to take away from this hint is up to you</p>

QUESTION: Could pascals triangle be refferenced without any additional proving?
ANSWER: you should prove anything you have not proven in class. I believe the only thing regarding Pascal&#39;s triangle that has already been demonstrated is pascal&#39;s identity

QUESTION: When we’re using induction, if while proving the k&#43;1th case and the k&#43;2th case is involved in the proof, do we need to use strong induction? Or is it only when the k-1th case is involved in the proof?
ANSWER: <p>I think it is extremely rare to see the $$k+2$$ case, and even more specifically, anything greater than the $$k+1$$ case in the induction step. And if you do see this, we often do some sort of reduction to get it into a value that is $$\leq k$$, because then it is easier to apply the induction hypothesis (since the IH is generally assumed for values up to and including $$k$$).</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, if you see that the induction step would be easily solved by &#34;borrowing&#34; results from values <em>less than</em> $$k$$, then strong induction may be the way to go.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

QUESTION: Do we need to prove that a remainder can range from 0 to (the number we are dividing with -1)?
ANSWER: no

QUESTION: Do we need to prove the definition of fibonnaci numbers or can we assume that they are made by summing the two preceding numbers?
ANSWER: That is a given in the question, so you don’t have to prove it

QUESTION: Do we need to have an extensive explanation for how we found the number of coefficients that are possible for question 1), or is it enough to say that we used the binomial theorem expansion and just say the number of coefficients. 
ANSWER: Some justification would be good to include

QUESTION: When solving part (b), are we allowed to assume that the recurrence relation from part (a) is true?
ANSWER: yeah

QUESTION: how much do we need to justify our recurrence relationship?
ANSWER: for q4 you don&#39;t have to justify part a

QUESTION: Will the solutions be HW 4H be published anytime soon? 
ANSWER: they are up now

QUESTION: I was just wondering if we learned everything we need to answer Q1 on Tuesday because we didn’t do graphs today
ANSWER: you can solve q1 without any knowledge of graphs

QUESTION: <p>&#34;Prove, using induction, that if there are n sections, Ishaan and Andrew can find a dead-end section of the field, if it exists.&#34;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Do we also need to show that Ishaan and Andrew can determine whether dead-end sections exist at all? Ie, in the case that there are no dead-end sections, do we need to show that they can determine that none exist with &lt;= 2(n-1) questions?</p>
ANSWER: Yes. Much like reality, Ishaan and Andrew aren&#39;t the smartest fellows, so they need to actually find out whether a dead-end section exists.

QUESTION: Do we have to prove the algebraic properties of phi and psi. (ex. that phi^2 = phi&#43;1)
ANSWER: you should show why this is true

QUESTION: ^Thank you so much
ANSWER: Everything needed to solve the questions has been taught already

QUESTION: <p>do the homies ishaan and andrew have to find ALL the dead-ends if there exist more than one or just a singular dead-end if any amount of dead-ends exist</p>
<p></p>
<p>thank you!</p>
ANSWER: All dead ends.

QUESTION: <p>When they ask the question “Can I get from section S to section T using a single walkway?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Is this simply checking if the pathway from S to T is only toward T / in both directions (i.e. S -&gt; T), or is this checking if there exists some chain of pathways that allow you to get from S to T (i.e. S -&gt; R -&gt; T)?</p>
ANSWER: The former

QUESTION: Are all the sections sorted into S and T such that any given section either belongs to S and T which would mean there are some sections that are both S (or both T) that can&#39;t have a walk way? 
ANSWER: $$S$$ and $$T$$ are just two arbitrary sections, not a collection of sections

QUESTION: Since there are any two sections S,T would have a walk way, does that mean that all sections are connected (in some way to another path)
ANSWER: sure, you can think about it that way

QUESTION: Do we have to prove concepts we learned in algebra like difference of squares of difference of cubes? 
ANSWER: You do not have to prove algebra

QUESTION: ^ just the title!
ANSWER: <p>$$a$$ and $$b$$ are said to be relatively prime if they share no common factors other than $$1$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Equivalently, the greatest common divisor of $$a$$ and $$b$$ must be 1.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Equivalently, $$\nexists x \in \mathbb Z^+$$ such that $$x \geq 2$$ and $$x \mid a \land x \mid b$$</p>

QUESTION: What does &#34;where n is not in the base case&#34; mean? Thank you!
ANSWER: you can ignore that. Just aim to prove that the equation holds true for all $$n \geq 0$$

QUESTION: <p>Suppose I had a procedure with Step 1 and Step 2, I prove both Step 1 and Step 2 with induction, and then I add them together. Does that count as doing the problem by &#34;induction&#34; for the sake of the HW?</p>
<p></p>
ANSWER: it&#39;s hard to answer this question without seeing your proof, but you should aim to do some sort of induction proof equivalent to what has been seen in lecture

QUESTION: If we need the induction hypothesis to be valid for a j=k and a j=k-1, should we just use strong induction or could we make our induction hypothesis say that &#34;assume that the claim holds when n=k or n=k-1&#34;.  Would either work?
ANSWER: <p>both are mathematically correct, with the latter still being strong induction with just fewer hypotheses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this class, the standard is to do strong induction with the full amount of hypotheses regardless if you need all of them or not</p>

QUESTION: Are we proving that there is a strategy that <span style="text-decoration:underline">always</span> works that allows Andrew and Ishaan to find the deadends within 2(n-1) questions or are we just showing that it is technically possible to figure out all the deadends with 2(n-1) questions, though one has to get lucky with the questions?
ANSWER: the former

QUESTION: Can the walkways be crossed any amount of times?
ANSWER: I’m not sure what you mean by this, as the amount of walkways crossed should not determine a dead-end. If you are asking about the question “can I go from S to T?”, then if the answer is “yes”, it means that you can go from S to T by traveling on a single walkway

QUESTION: Is there always a fixed configuration of fish or can we arrange them in any order we want?
ANSWER: the configuration is fixed

QUESTION: <p>I&#39;m having trouble understanding what exactly is a deadend visually, would this be correct?</p>
<p><img src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fllwet9ed4gwj0%2F7beb4d6cacf1157ae5de294f1ad8a7a45225e12f471bfb473b25c6eced77a02f%2FWhatsApp_Image_2023-10-01_at_12.25.43_6ebd79ae.jpg" alt="WhatsApp_Image_2023-10-01_at_12.25.43_6ebd79ae.jpg" /></p>
ANSWER: <p>$$c$$ would not be a deadend, because it is possible to travel from $$c$$ to another section (in this case, $$a$$).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally, please note that there is a walkway between every pair of sections (your diagram does not have one between $$b$$ and $$c$$)</p>

QUESTION: If the answer to “Can I get from section S to section T using a single walkway?” is no does that mean S is a dead-end or T is a dead-end or neither is a dead-end?
ANSWER: this is something we&#39;d like you to think about

QUESTION: i found a proof for q1 without using induction. how to phrase a non-induction proof to an induction proof?
ANSWER: a question like this is more suitable for office hours

QUESTION: Can my proof to be half induction half implicit?

QUESTION: If n = 4, and there are n &#43; 1 friends so 5 friends, does this mean that those 5 friends can have any number of socks from 1 - 8(2n)?
ANSWER: yeah

QUESTION: because it&#39;s if and only if. Do I need to prove that when all the fish is gold, there must be odd number of blue to start with, and if there are odd number of blue to start with, then i can make all of them gold? Can i just prove that if it&#39;s odd, then i can prove all the fish can be turned gold, if it&#39;s even, then i can prove that it won&#39;t turn all the fish gold?
ANSWER: This is something we’d like you to think about

QUESTION: For writing the induction hypothesis, should I be using the sequence I found in part A to do so?
ANSWER: This is something you should think about. Keep in mind that part b is asking you to prove that $$S(n) = \varphi^n + \psi^n$$ for all $$n$$.

QUESTION: Do the review office hours continue this week?
ANSWER: Yes, look out for a piazza post regarding the timing of it sometime tomorrow.

QUESTION: Just wanted to clarify, if there are 4 trees in the field, there are 6 total walkways between every pair of trees?
ANSWER: yes

QUESTION: Is a walkway from A to B to C considered a single walkway from A to C?
ANSWER: no

QUESTION: Do we need to use induction to prove question 3?
ANSWER: you can use any proof technique you want

QUESTION: If there are no paths to a certain section and there only paths going out of that section, would it be considered a dead end? There are ways to exit but there aren&#39;t any ways to enter in this case. 
ANSWER: No. A dead-end is a section that you cannot exit from.

QUESTION: Does S(n) just refer to nth term in the sequence? So it would be the same as S_n?
ANSWER: almost. $$S(n)$$ means the function $$S$$ applied on $$n$$. But in this context, you can think of them as nearly the same. Just note that $$n \geq 0$$

QUESTION: For Q3, can pigeonhole principle be used to say, instead of 2 pigeons going into 1 pigeonhole, 1 pigeon is left out and must go in another pigeonhole (pigeonhole in between two filled pigeonholes)?
ANSWER: I&#39;m not quite sure what this means, but do note that with PHP, you are not fixing how the pigeons fall into the holes (so you should not be discussing any worst case argument). PHP is applicable for <em>all</em> cases of pigeons falling into holes.

QUESTION: Do I have to prove that an even number plus one is an odd number and that a odd number &#43; 1 is an even number. Also even number minus one is odd and vice versa.
ANSWER: no

QUESTION: If we are multiplying, adding, and subtracting by integers in an expression, do we have to prove that the resulting number is also an integer?
ANSWER: No

QUESTION: In lecture 5t, the last induction proof, why do they not do a proof for both directs for the iff statement? Is this logic applicable for all questions with biconditional statements?
ANSWER: <p>That induction proof is proving both directions at the same time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The forwards direction reads &#34;If the first player has a winning strategy, then $$n \neq 4k + 1$$&#34;. We use the contrapositive (which is logically equivalent) to rewrite this as &#34;If $$n = 4k + 1$$ then the first player loses&#34;. Note that this statement appears in our definition of $$P(n)$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The backwards direction is &#34;if $$n \neq 4k + 1$$ then the first player has a winning strategy&#34;, and this is also encapsulated in the definition of $$P(n)$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the induction step, we show both of these at the same time.</p>

QUESTION: Do you always have at least one blue fish to begin with? Because if they were all red, then you can&#39;t really turn them gold. 
ANSWER: <p>Good observation. The problem is asking you to prove that Megan can make all $$n$$ fish gold if and only if the number of fish that <strong>are initially blue is <span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>odd</em></span><span style="text-decoration:underline">.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"></span></strong></p>
<p>So is it an issue if there are no blue fish to start with?</p>

QUESTION: Do we have to prove that odd numbers can only have odd factors?
ANSWER: a brief justification would suffice

QUESTION: Do I have to prove the following lemma that two consecutive integers are relatively prime?
ANSWER: you should

QUESTION: Do we have to provide a strategy for Megan to feed the fish or can we assume that Megan will feed optimally?
ANSWER: You don&#39;t have to necessarily provide a strategy, but you must ensure that it is possible to feed the fish in such a way to ensure they are all gold

QUESTION: Do we need to provide justification for the assumption we make in our induction hypotheses? Like, for #1, when I cite &#34;by IH, we know Ishaan and Andrew can find all existing dead-ends for k total sections with at most 2(k-1) questions,&#34; do I have to say how they would do that (by asking if S_1-&gt;S_2, S_1-&gt;S_3,...,S_1-&gt;S_k is possible and if S_k-&gt;S_1,...,S_2-&gt;S_1 is possible for 2(k-1) questions total)?
ANSWER: It depends on what your induction hypothesis is. Citing and applying your IH will only give you information about what you have assumed

QUESTION: <p>I am sorry but what topic is this question from? I cannot find anything in the lecture notes about recurrence relations and</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>algebraic relationships between phi and psi</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
ANSWER: not all questions that appear on homework will be direct analogues of what you see in lecture. That being said, you are equipped with the skills to solve the problem.

QUESTION: If we define the IH for 1 &lt;= j &lt;= k, should the IS be for j &#43; 1 or k &#43; 1? <br /><br />if k &#43; 1, then when we break it down to k, do we say that k is less than or equal to j so IH applies?
ANSWER: <p>The induction step should be for $$k + 1$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the second question, if that condition is held, then yes.</p>

QUESTION: If we say that WLOG, let the first fish in line always be blue and let k =1, and we prove it for these conditions, is that enough of a proof overall? 
ANSWER: this is something you should think about

QUESTION: Proving that the even number of blue fish cannot all be turned gold by holding on to the WLOG statement (first fish in line is blue, k =1 so 2 blue fish), we turn the first blue fish gold. For the adjacent fish: <br /><br /> Case 1: if the adjacent fish is blue, it will turn red and there are no more blue fish =&gt; at least one non-gold fish left<br /><br />Case 2: if adjacent fish is red, it will turn blue and we again have 2 blue fish. These leads us back to Case 1 as sort of an iteration/recursion. So if we have sufficient proof for Case 1, can we extend it to Case 2 if it reaches the same &#34;form&#34; as Case 1? <br /><br />
ANSWER: questions like this are more suitable for office hours

QUESTION: I saw in another post that you said we must identify &#34;all dead ends.&#34; Is it not true that since there are walkways between all sections, there can only be one dead end? (Since all other sections other than that dead-end have an outlet to the dead-end?) Just wanted to clarify.
ANSWER: I won&#39;t give you a solid yes/no answer to this question (because I am mean), but you have identified the key part (all pairs of sections have walkways) that will help you confirm the answer to this question.

QUESTION: What does it mean by &#34;where n is not in the base case(s)&#34;
ANSWER: @545

QUESTION: I&#39;m using that phi and psi are the solutions to x^2 - x - 1 = 0, but is it enough to state this or do I need to solve/work backwards to show that this is true?
ANSWER: You should briefly show why this is true (plug phi and psi in for x)

QUESTION: For this question, do we assume that it is possible when adding the k &#43; 1st section that Andrew and Ishaan already used up 2(k - 1) questions, leaving only 2 more questions?
ANSWER: I don’t think you can make that assumption unfounded

QUESTION: Do I have to prove the statement in the title?
ANSWER: Is this true? Take $$k = 3$$ and $$n = 7$$. You would be suggesting that the largest multiple of $$3$$ less than $$7$$ is $$\lfloor \frac73\rfloor = 2$$

QUESTION: If by contradiction, we prove that all n fish can be turned gold if initial blue fish are even, is one counter-example of an even number of initially blue fish sufficient to prove that this is not true?
ANSWER: resolved

QUESTION: Do I need to prove If an integer x divides two integers a and b, then x also divides their difference?<br />
ANSWER: you should briefly justify this

QUESTION: Do we need to prove that when expressing odd number = a &#43; b, a and b must be one odd and one even?
ANSWER: no

QUESTION: Do we still have to prove if we add two even number their sum is an even number in our homework? 
ANSWER: no

QUESTION: Can we approach the sequence through trial and error and then make a generalized relationship?
ANSWER: sure

QUESTION: Can we use the recurrence relation S(n) found in part (a) to use in the induction in part (b)? Do we have to include the relation in the induction hypothesis?
ANSWER: you can use it if you wish to. Where you choose to use it is up to you

QUESTION: Proof by contradiction: all n fish can be turned gold if initial blue fish are even.<br />Is one counter-example of an even number of initially blue fish sufficient to prove that this is not true?
ANSWER: this is something you should think about. It may help to remember that you are proving an &#34;if and only if&#34; relationship

QUESTION: Do we have to prove that a nonnegative even integer can always be expressed as the sum of two nonnegative even integers?
ANSWER: a short explanation would suffice

<p>You cannot move fish around</p>

QUESTION: <p>I wasn&#39;t able to submit my homework through Gradescope (sent to cis1600 course email) because cis1600 course was removed from my Gradescope. I tried multiple times to add the course back from my account but got a &#34;invalid format&#34; error message. <br /><br /></p>
<p>Could you look into this? I was registered with my school email (lkwak@seas.upenn.edu) but no longer have access to past grades and assignments. Is there a separate link outside of the 1600 course website?</p>
ANSWER: It seems like you are still on the gradescope roster on our end. Can you try re-joining the class using entry code <strong>XVZBGK? </strong>It is possible that gradescope may have just been down for a bit last night

QUESTION: Does Nathan only eat one cookie each time? 
ANSWER: yeah

QUESTION: Do I have to prove why if there is an edge between every two vertices in a graph with n vertices, then the number of edges is $$n\choose2$$?
ANSWER: You should justify this

QUESTION: The question states that m ≥ 0 milk rivers form between pairs of cookies. This implies that a vertex of this graph is a pair of cookies and not a single cookie. But the statement right after contradicts this. I am confused?
ANSWER: A milk river connects a pair of cookies (it connects a single cookie to another single cookie)

QUESTION: For section a of Q1, is cookie number 1 different from cookie number n?
ANSWER: Yes

QUESTION: Where can I redeem my chocolate chip cookie after solving Q3?
ANSWER: You’ll have to contact Cookie Monster at CookieMonsterOmNomNom1@gmail.com

QUESTION: Is a Xin-Mint a type of cookie? 
ANSWER: Yeah

QUESTION: When using proof by induction do we necessarily have to use the IH in our IS? 
ANSWER: Yes

QUESTION: For the maximum, if two numbers are equal is there still a maximum? For example, if we roll a 1 and a 1 can we say the maximum between the two numbers was a 1? 
ANSWER: Yes, $$\max(x, x) = x$$

QUESTION: Is x one arbitrary value between 1 and 6, or all values between 1 and 6?
ANSWER: Your solution should work for all values of $$x$$ between $$1$$ and $$6$$

QUESTION: Let&#39;s say I&#39;m attempting to use induction to prove that x - y &lt; 3x. Would it be sufficient to say that x - y &lt; 3x ⟺ y &lt; 4x, and then use induction to prove that y &lt; 4x?
ANSWER: I think you have a small error with the inequality. It should be that $$x - y < 3x \iff y > -2x$$ or instead $$y - x < 3x \iff y < 4x$$.

let&#39;s go with the latter case. In this case, you <em>could</em> prove by induction that $$y < 4x$$ and then go backwards, but it only works in this case because the algebra done one both sides of the inequality forms an &#34;if and only if&#34; relationship. That is, the addition of $$x$$ on both sides is an &#34;if and only if&#34; relationship. But you should be careful in general, because not all algebra forms this &#34;if and only if&#34; relationship.

In general, if possible, it is best to avoid manipulating what you are trying to prove, as it will leave less room for error

QUESTION: Can I clarify for 1f that you just give a single equation in terms of x instead of saying that when (x = 1, Pr[A] = ...),  (x= 2, Pr[A] = ...)
ANSWER: correct

QUESTION: Is it permissible to use an induction proof? Or is this against the question’s intention?
ANSWER: You can use whatever proof technique you would like

QUESTION: Does &#34;no higher than 10&#34; mean from 2-9 or from 2-10? (Sorry if this seems trivial haha)
ANSWER: 2 - 10 inclusive

QUESTION: Do the rivers go in a straight line or could I have the same river going between two gaps 
ANSWER: I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &#34;gaps&#34;, but the shape of the rivers doesn&#39;t really matter. What matters is that a milk river connects two cookies

QUESTION: can we assume that the events of eating the first and second cookies independent of each other based on the statement: <br /> &#34;Nathan can eat the same cookie for lunch and dinner if he wants&#34; <br /><br />does this mean that the sample space remains the same? 
ANSWER: this is something we&#39;d like you to think about

QUESTION: is x an integer?
ANSWER: yes

QUESTION: Can we use a calculator to simplify our fraction?

ANSWER: No, this is allowed

QUESTION: ^^question above, sorry this may be a tad bit late to ask
ANSWER: You should provide the probability as well as a justification as to how the probability was obtained (similar format to how you would write up solutions to counting problems)

QUESTION: In our solutions, do we need to talk about |\Omega| and define the set A blah blah as was done in the lecture, or can we just say something like &#34;The total number of ways to choose ___ is x because ...&#34;
ANSWER: you must always define your sample space $$\Omega$$. Computing the cardinality is up to you.

It is also extremely good practice to define events.

QUESTION: Is 6H the last homework before the exam?
ANSWER: Yes. @562 may be of interest

QUESTION: In question 5, if n is odd, is each baker friends with floor(n/2) bakers or ceil(n/2) bakers?
ANSWER: $$\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$$

A good reason as to why this is the case is if $$n$$ is odd, then $$n = 2k + 1$$, so $$\frac{n}{2} = \frac{2k + 1}{2} = k + \frac12 = k + 0.5$$.

We know that $$k$$ is an integer. 

The amount of friends the baker should have is at least $$\frac{n}{2}$$ which can be rewritten as $$\geq \frac{n}{2}$$.

Suppose, for example, that $$k = 3$$, then to be friends with at least 3.5 bakers would be the same as being friends with $$4$$ bakers, since we cannot have a fractional friend. this generalizes for all values of $$k$$, that being friends with at least $$k + 0.5$$ bakers is equivalent to being friends with at least $$k + 1$$ bakers

QUESTION: <p>Do we need to represent each element of $$\Omega$$ as some tuple or ordered pair as show in lecture 5H?</p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, in problem 3, are we allowed to say that &#34;The sample space is the set of ways for Ria to distribute the 9 cookies to the 4 customers&#34;, or do we need to say something like &#34;Each outcome in $$\Omega$$ can be represented as a 4-tuple....&#34;?</p>
ANSWER: <p>We have previously been quite lenient in how you define $$\Omega$$ in the past. However, if you rely on some sort of implicit structure of the outcomes within your solution, then it is usually define such a structure when defining $$\Omega$$.<br /><br />For example, if you define $$\Omega$$ to be the &#34;set of ways for Ria to distribute the 9 cookies to the 4 customers&#34; and later in the solution you write something like &#34;looking at the <em>second position</em> of the outcome, blah blah blah&#34;, then it&#39;s a bit stylistically unpleasant because we don&#39;t really know what a &#34;position&#34; is. Since the structure of an outcome in $$\Omega$$ wasn&#39;t well defined, we could have $$\Omega$$ be a set of tuples, a set of sequences, or even a set of sets (in this case, the word &#34;position&#34; wouldn&#39;t make much sense since sets are unordered).</p>
<p></p>
<p>My advice is to give structure to your outcomes regardless if you choose to use said structure or not.</p>

QUESTION: <p>I don&#39;t think I understand the question for Q5. If Suzzy, Chris, Adam, and Liz, are in the baking class, there are 4 bakers, and Suzzy has to be friends with at least 2 bakers. Let&#39;s say she&#39;s friends with Chris and Adam. They themselves also both have to be friends with at least 2 bakers. </p>
<p>Couldn&#39;t it be possible that </p>
<p>Chris is friends with Suzzy and Adam.</p>
<p>Adam is friends with Suzzy and Chris. </p>
<p>and then Liz never learns the technique?</p>
ANSWER: <p>&#34;Each of the $$n$$ bakers is friends with at least $$n/2$$ bakers&#34;.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In your example, Liz is not friends with $$n/2$$ bakers</p>

QUESTION: are the cookies distinguishable? 
ANSWER: @665

QUESTION: <p>My current understanding is that the journey (the loop) must visit each bakery each once and also end where it started.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Consider the statement (which we must prove): &#34;if there exactly n cookie named streets, then there exists exactly one loop around the bakeries&#34;. If n=4, let the bakeries be A, B, C, and D. Suppose bakeries A, B, and C are pairwise connected, and that D is connected to A. This is 4 cookie named streets, but we cannot both visit each bakery once and also end where we started.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Is there something that I am misunderstanding?</p>
ANSWER: Yeah I think the question is slightly misworded. The loop doesn’t have to visit ALL bakeries, just some of them. So in the example you provided, ABC would create the loop

QUESTION: can we say that the probability of something is equal to 1-(not probability)?
ANSWER: Sure, this is definition of complement

QUESTION: Are the cookies within each type of cookie indistinguishable? For example, does it matter if I choose the first P.I.E cookie and then choose the third Chocolate Counting cookie available?
ANSWER: This depends on how you define your sample space

QUESTION: I don&#39;t understand how this sentence, &#34;he then randomly selects a member of Team<br />Milk, and finds them to be lactose intolerant,&#34; is related to the actual question, &#34;What is the probability that the Team Anti-Milk member transferred by the Milkman™ to Team Milk was lactose intolerant?&#34;. Is the first sentence just a part of the lore or is it actually relevant to the question? Whatever happens after the transfer doesn&#39;t seem to matter, but maybe I&#39;m missing something.
ANSWER: This is something you should really think about. It may be possible that not all information in the problem is relevant to solving it. But it may be the case that the information influences some of your calculations. 

QUESTION: Can Eric have 0 or 8 cookies? (is it inclusive)
ANSWER: yes

QUESTION: Are the bakery streets one-way streets?
ANSWER: <p>Also, must they visit every vertice?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here&#39;s an example of a graph with n&#43;1 edges in which there is only one loop that travels to each vertice.<img src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fllwacgnlxt176g%2F7ccd41b291dab20a306f6785311f52cc2a0c69f446ff41c0ce0618fd2b2231ee%2FIMG_0495.jpg" alt="IMG_0495.jpg" /></p>

QUESTION: Do we need to justify that adding an edge to a tree creates exactly one cycle? I&#39;ve shown that it introduces at least one cycle, but how much detail do I need to show it&#39;s the only one?
ANSWER: yes you should prove this

QUESTION: <p>Suppose a, b, and c are all equal to 1 and Luna gives Helen a type a cookie for the first day. The second day, does she now have to choose from the remaining 2 or is she gonna have a, b, and c all equal to 1 again?</p>
<p>Basically I am unsure about the meaning of &#34;for each of the next two days.&#34;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

QUESTION: title.
ANSWER: the problem mentions that they are distinguishable

QUESTION: <p>If I want to say that there is a 3/4 chance of a lactose intolerant TA being transferred from Anti-Milk to Milk, since there are 3 intolerant TAs and 4 total TAs on team Anti-Milk, is that considered obvious enough to just state or do I still have to write out the sample space of all ways to choose a TA from Anti-milk, define event E, etc. just to calculate that? Since in class, we were given percentages like 90% for these types of problems.</p>
<p></p>
<p>btw I&#39;m not talking about after Milkman finds the person to be intolerant, this is an intermediate calculation before all of the conditional probability stuff.</p>
ANSWER: you can just state it.

QUESTION: <p>&#34;Eric tells Nathan that the chance that any two of his lost cookies, uniformly chosen at random, both being O-Ria-s, is exactly 1/2&#34;</p>
<p></p>
<p>In Q4, when referencing the above part, are his lost cookies chosen individually at random, so like the first cookie would be chosen and then the next cookies (of the lost ones)?</p>
<p></p>
<p>(Also, the number of lost cookies is the same even after Nathan finds 2 of them right?) </p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
ANSWER: <p>the cookies are not being chosen with replacement, if that is what you are asking.</p>
<p></p>
<p>yes to the parenthetical question</p>

QUESTION: Is a brief text justification enough for why a sample space has a uniform probability distribution?  For example, if we know that each outcome in the sample space of rolling a single dice has the same probability, can we say that that implies that, when rolling two die, a sample space comprised of outcomes that are tuples with the result of the first dice and result of the second dice in the tuple (ordered) also has a uniform probability distribution?
ANSWER: yes

QUESTION: Can we say &#34;by definition of a tree&#34; when discussing acyclic connected graphs or do we need to prove this?

QUESTION: Hi, I know this would vary by the individual, but I was wondering (given the low raw exam grades from past years) if students generally don&#39;t finish the whole exam on time, or if they do but make a bunch of mistakes. Thank you!
ANSWER: <p>This is, as you mentioned, dependent on the student. It is also hard to answer this question due to differing test taking strategies. For example, some students prefer to spend all of their time on a few questions and ensure that they get them completely correct, whereas other students will spend a little bit of time on each and every one of the problems. While both of these students may end up with the same grade, one finished the exam while the other did not.</p>

QUESTION: <p>Q6 starts off by saying that there are 160 TAs, but then says &#34;the 9 TAs break into two groups.&#34; The rest of the problem doesn&#39;t seem to use the other 151 TAs. Why does it say there are 160 TAs?</p>
<p></p>
ANSWER: 160 is being used as an adjective, not a quantity. So we can reword the question as &#34;A group of diagnosed insomiac TAs of the course CIS160 get into a kerfuffle...&#34;

QUESTION: Might be a weird question to ask, but for the sake of eco consciousness, in Q2, can Luna reuse the leftover cookies from the first day?  For ex, if she bakes a total of a&#43;b&#43;c cookies on the first day and Helen gets one she has a&#43;b&#43;c-1 cookies left. Does she throw this away (sad) or leave this as an option that makes the second-day options a&#43;b&#43;c&#43;(a&#43;b&#43;c-1) to choose from?

ANSWER: No. Just refer to lectures to determine midterm content

QUESTION: I can&#39;t find any reference to an explicit answer to this question: how do we prove that a sample space is uniform (and how rigorous must the proof be?)
ANSWER: For this class, you do not need to worry about thoroughly proving why your sample space is uniform. You can just state that it is uniform (if it actually is)

QUESTION: Are customer&#39;s hands distinguishable? For example, is customer 1 getting a cookie on their right hand considered different from getting a cookie on their left hand?
ANSWER: A customer&#39;s right hand is considered equivalent to the same customer&#39;s left hand. <br /><br />However, hands between customers are distinguishable

QUESTION: Is each of the 4 cookies of a TA distinguishable from each other?
ANSWER: this depends on how you choose to define your sample space

QUESTION: What does tossing really mean? Is it the same as distribution, or does tossing to the first customer and then the second count as a different case from tossing to the second customer then the first even when the cookies are indistinguishable? 
ANSWER: you can think of it as the same as distribution. Tossing to the first customer and then to the second is considered the same as tossing to the second then tossing to the first since the final states are the same

QUESTION: Does hit-and-trial constitute a valid proof if I show all cases? Basically if I end up with an equation and set of inequalities that only allow 5-10 possible solutions, is it acceptable to check all of them instead of trying to solve it further?
ANSWER: @603

QUESTION: Are we allowed to assume a prior probability that the Milkman selected a lactose intolerant team member? 
ANSWER: no

QUESTION: Can we define sample spaces as factorial expressions or would we have to simplify them out? e.g. in selecting 2 elements from 4 elements without replacement, can we write that as 4! / 2! or would we have to write out 4 * 3
ANSWER: sample spaces are sets, not numbers. When calculating its cardinality, you can leave it as an expression

QUESTION: When Ria throws her 9 cookies, is it possible for a customer to get two cookies (one on left and one on right hand) or is it max one per customer (so it only lands in one hand)?
ANSWER: does @712 help

QUESTION: I make the claim that if there are multiple connected components of a graph with n vertices, then there must be less than or equal to n/2 vertices in at least one of the connected components. Is this a fair statement or must I provide justification?

QUESTION: What would the notation look like? Like if we had an event A, could we partition the complement of A as follows:$$A^c = A_1^c + A_2^c$$
ANSWER: $$\bar{A}$$ is typical for complement, so you could do $$\bar{A}_1, \bar{A}_2$$. But you should make it very clear that $$\bar{A}_1 \cup \bar{A}_2 \cup ... \cup \bar{A}_n = \bar{A}$$

QUESTION: Could we go over what we&#39;re supposed to do in question 9? Are we supposed to solve for the number of ways guests can be paired up, the number of possible donations, or something else?
ANSWER: your solution should account for the amount of ways to pair <em>and </em>donate

QUESTION: I know that in the lecture notes, this was proved using contradiction. Could we prove this using the contrapositive, and if we can how would the proof look?
ANSWER: <p>The contrapositive statement is: If $$n$$ is even, then $$3n + 2$$ is even.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If $$n$$ is even, then $$n = 2k$$ for some $$k \in \mathbb Z$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, $$3n + 2 = 3(2k) + 2 = 6k + 2 = 2(3k + 1)$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We know that $$3k + 1 \in \mathbb Z$$ since $$k \in \mathbb Z$$, so $$3n + 2$$ is also even. qed</p>

QUESTION: In 7T  lecture notes, it says that &#34;G − {e} has n vertices and n − 2 edges. We know that such a graph has at least 2 connected components and hence is disconnected.&#34; What is the justification for this?
ANSWER: <p>In lecture 6T you proved the following:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Every graph with n vertices and m edges has at least n − m connected components</p>
<p></p>
<p>So we&#39;re just using the above to justify it.</p>

QUESTION: For the question that asks to find 8-letter strings with different numbers of vowels, for the portion of the question where we want to count all 8-letter strings with <em>distinct</em> letters that have 3, 4, or 5 vowels, why does step 2 have P(5, i) ways of doing it instead of $$\binom{5}{i}$$ ways? Are you not choosing i of the 5 vowels to use in the spots you&#39;ve chosen in step 1?
ANSWER: <p>Well almost. You can think of doing $$\binom{5}{i}$$ as choosing $$i$$ of the 5 vowels to use. But you still need to assign the vowels to the $$i$$ spots. So the first vowel spot would have $$i$$ options, the second vowel spot would have $$i-1$$ options, and so on until the $$i$$th vowel spot has $$1$$ option.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So in total, the amount of ways to assign the vowels is $$\binom{5}{i} \cdot i!$$, but this is just equal to $$P(5, i)$$</p>

QUESTION: <p>What is the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 10 whose terms are<br />taken from 1 through 25? </p>
<p></p>
<p>This was a question from lecture 3H, for which I originally assumed that there can only be 1 of each number (we can only use the number 2 once in our list, if we decide to use it). In the solution, however, it seems like we assumed that we can use the same number twice. How do we know just from the wording of the problem that we can use a number twice? Do we assume that we can use a number twice unless it explicitly tells us each number can only be used once? </p>
<p></p>
<p>Also, for this question, how do we know whether or not each number 2 that we use in our list is distinct or not? </p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
ANSWER: <p>In this question, &#34;non-decreasing&#34; indicates that the sequence is never decreasing, but it could stay the same. So for example: 1, 2, 3, 4 is non-decreasing because it never decreases, but so is 1, 2, 2, 4. So repetitions would be allowed. For the sake of the exam, we&#39;ll make it clear what we are looking for. If not, just ask.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the last question, I don&#39;t think it really matters. But the number 2 is indistinguishable from the number 2.</p>

QUESTION: <p>Consider 3 books: a computer science book, a math book, and a history book. Suppose the library has at least 6 copies of each of these books. How many ways are there to select 6 books?</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the lecture notes, we used the sticks and crosses method. If we were to remove the condition that the library has at least 6 copies of each of the books, and replace it with there are 5 of each type, that means we can no longer use the sticks and crosses method right?</p>
ANSWER: You would not be able to use sticks and crosses because doing so would allow for the situation of choosing 6 of the same type of book which is not allowed if there are only 5.

ANSWER: I’ll give you the argument for $$\binom{11}{2}$$ and the other cases follow similarly.<div><br /></div><div>Consider the event $$X_i \cap X_j$$. This occurs when exactly two of the variables are equal to zero, so the equation simplifies to $$x_k + x_l = 10$$</div><div><br /></div><div>We now treat this as sticks and crosses where the variables are distinct containers (so the plus sign is the stick) and the units of 10 are the crosses.</div><div><br /></div><div>So by formula, $$\binom{11}{10}$$</div>

QUESTION: Does the union-bound definition only apply for probabilities, or does it also apply to sets? For example, can I say that |S1 U S2| &lt;= |S1| &#43; |S2| by union-bound, or do I have to show the following:<br /><br />|S1 U S2| = |S1| &#43; |S2| - |S1 <b>∩ </b>S2| by PIE, and |S1 <b>∩ </b>S2| must be positive, and then the top inequality follows.
ANSWER: It applies for sets! You proved so on a homework!

ANSWER: Monday OH will run as normal

QUESTION: In Q3, why do we have to partition instead of just stating that it is the permutation P(8,5)? Thank you!
ANSWER: A permutation would overcount. Permutations work for a set and sets have distinct values. Since there are two $$2$$&#39;s, we can&#39;t quite just say $$P(8, 5)$$

QUESTION: <p>how come 4b is not accounting for order (12 choose 2), but then 4d is accounting for order (13*12). Shouldn&#39;t 4d be (13 choose 2) for which two different values to choose from?</p>
<p><img src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkepunf56cid5uk%2Fb3deb9f0a847fa08c3040ef1052933f5cecfdd4a97688d44bfa3f3ec3e25c576%2FScreenshot_2023-10-14_at_10.49.17_AM.png" alt="Screenshot_2023-10-14_at_10.49.17_AM.pngNaN" /></p>
ANSWER: <p>4d isn&#39;t really accounting for order. We can rewrite 4d with a more thorough procedure.</p>
<p>Step 1) Choose which value will form the three-of-a-kind</p>
<p>Step 2) Choose which three suits of the above value to have.</p>
<p>Step 3) Choose which value will form the pair.</p>
<p>Step 4) Choose which two suits of the above value to have.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Step 1 can be performed in $$\binom{13}{1}$$ ways, step 2 in $$\binom{4}{3}$$, step 3 in $$\binom{13-1}{1}$$, and step 4 in $$\binom{4}{2}$$. Then just use MR and you get the same answer presented</p>

QUESTION: When finding the number of pairings why do we have to divide by 50! ? I thought that by just simplifying combinations (100 choose 2 times 98 choose 2 times 96 choose 2 and so on), we would get 100!/2^50. How would this overcount, I thought that order did not matter for combinations?
ANSWER: <p>The order <em>within</em> the pair doesn&#39;t matter, but you should also consider the order of how you <em>select</em> the pairs. For example, if you do the $$\binom{100}{2}$$ followed by $$\binom{98}{2}$$ and so on approach, then consider the following scenario:</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the first step, the first two people we chose to form a group may be person $$A$$ and person $$B$$. And in step 2, when we are choosing 2 from the remaining 98 to form a pair, we may choose person $$C$$ and person $$D$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But currently, this would be <em>different</em> than in step 1 choosing people $$C$$ and $$D$$ and in step 2 choosing $$A$$ and $$B$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Since we want the above two to be considered the same (i.e. the ordering of the <em>pairs themselves</em> don&#39;t matter), we have to divide by $$50!$$</p>

QUESTION: For question 6, can we prove it using induction? If so, how would the inductive step look like?
ANSWER: <p>Here&#39;s a sketch of the IS:</p>
<p></p>
<p>We want to show $$(a+1)^2 > 2(a+1) + 1$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$(a+1)^2 = a^2 + 2a + 1 > 2a + 2a + 1 $$ by IH</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$ \geq 2a + 6 + 1$$ since $$a \geq 3$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\geq 2a + 3 = 2(a+1) + 1$$</p>

QUESTION: On the lecture notes for 1T, an example proposition was given: ∀x ∈ Z, x^3 &#43; 1 is composite. However, if x = 1, isn&#39;t 2 a prime number? 
ANSWER: <p>A proposition is a statement to which it is possible to assign a value of either true or false.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So yes, $$\forall x \in \mathbb Z, x^3 + 1$$ is composite is indeed false. But that does not change it from being a proposition</p>

QUESTION: Hi, I was just wondering whether calculators would be allowed on the upcoming midterm.
ANSWER: they are not allowed

QUESTION: <p>Example. Suppose each point in the plane is colored either red or blue. Show that there always exist two points of the same color that are exactly one feet apart.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Solution. Consider an equilateral triangle with the length of each side being one feet. The three corners of the triangle are colored red or blue. By pigeonhole principle, two of these three points must have the same color.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Question: How would we prove that such an equilateral triangle exists on the plane?</p>
ANSWER: Any spot on the plane is a point, so if we were to just draw a triangle on a plane, its corners must be points on the plane

QUESTION: Why wouldn&#39;t &#34;there exists an m for all n for all p&#34; be a valid solution? If you let m = 2p - n &#43; 1, wouldn&#39;t that be a possible m such that the inequality holds?
ANSWER: No, you would have to provide a single value of $$m$$ that is not dependent on $$n$$ and $$p$$

<p>Although we state that each set in S2 is of this form, do we not also need to prove that for every X there must be a set in S2? If not, why not? If yes, how would we go about this? Thank you!</p>
ANSWER: You would only need to prove it if it is relevant to the proof. I may not be fully understanding your question so feel free to follow up.

QUESTION: Hello, is the 6H *HW* going to be fair game for the test? I ask because the HW often corresponds to the previous lecture and the questions seem to work. Thank you!
ANSWER: There are some concepts covered in HW6H that are fair game for the exam, but these are only concepts that were covered in lecture content up to and including lecture 6T. So for example, Q1 could be considered &#34;fair game&#34; because it is a uniform probability space question, but something like q6 wouldn&#39;t appear on the exam because it covers conditional probability which was not covered in lectures up to and including 6T

QUESTION: <p>I don&#39;t understand the latter part of the explanation. Could someone give a more detailed explanation?</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#34;Clearly, this sequence is also a strictly increasing sequence. The numbers a1, a2, . . . , a77, a1&#43; 21, a2&#43;21, . . . , a77&#43;21 (154 in all) belong to the set {1, 2, . . . , 153}. By the pigeonhole principle there must be two numbers out of the 154 numbers that must be the same. Since no two numbers in a1, a2, . . . , a77 are equal and no two numbers in a1 &#43; 21, a2 &#43; 21, . . . , a77 &#43; 21 are equal there must exist i and j such that ai = aj&#43;21. Hence during the days j&#43;1, j&#43;2, . . . , i, exactly 21 games must have been played.&#34;</p>
ANSWER: <p>By PHP, we must have that two of $$a_1, a_2, ..., a_{77}, a_1 + 21, a_2 + 21, ..., a_{77} + 21$$ are equal. Since $$a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{77}$$ it follows that $$a_1 \neq a_2 \neq ... \neq a_{77}$$ and similarly, $$a_i + 21 < a_2 + 21 < ... < a_{77} + 21$$ so $$a_1 + 21 \neq a_2 + 21 \neq .. \neq a_{77} + 21$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thus, if $$A = \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_{77}\}$$ and $$B = \{a_1 + 21, a_2 + 21, ..., a_{77} + 21\}$$, from the pigeonhole argument, the two values that are the same MUST come from different sets. That is, $$\exists a_i \in A$$ and $$\exists a_j + 21 \in B$$ such that $$a_i = a_j + 21$$. The rest follows from this.</p>

QUESTION: <p dir="ltr"><br />Is this true?<br /><br />we can either fix the sticks and arrange the crosses or vice versa<br /><br />C (sticks &#43; crosses, sticks) = C (stick &#43; crosses, crosses)</p>
ANSWER: yep. This follows from the fact that $$\binom{n+m}{n} = \binom{n+m}{m}$$

QUESTION: Would it be possible to do this problem with multi-sets, if yes, how would we go about doing that?
ANSWER: Sure, you&#39;d have to start by counting the number of non-empty subsets (that are multisets) of the original multiset of houses.

QUESTION: <p>For one of the questions in Lecture 6T, we use induction on m edges to figure out the number of connected components and prove the claim.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My question is how do we know what to induct on for these questions? It isn&#39;t very intuitive for me.</p>
ANSWER: <p>What you induct on really depends on the problem. Also, both induction on edges and induction on vertices have their own separate issues, so it just depends.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, inducting on vertices can sometimes be annoying because when you remove a vertex, you also have to remove all incident edges. But at the same time, inducting on vertices can be nice when you can guarantee existence of a specific type of vertex in a graph (i.e a leaf in a tree)</p>
<p></p>
<p>What&#39;s nice about edge induction is that when you remove an edge, you don&#39;t <em>have</em> to remove any vertices, but removing edges can disconnect the graph, and removing edges in general may not be as easy to generalize as removing vertices.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the case of the lecture notes problem, I would be tipped to doing induction on edges because we are just looking at an arbitrary graph and don&#39;t know much about its structure. Had we chosen to induct on vertices and remove a vertex in the Induction step, we&#39;d have to worry about its connectivity to all other vertices as well as how many edges we removed (especially since the claim depends on the number of edges).</p>
<p></p>
<p>By inducting on edges, we have much less to be concerned about. Often, trial-and-error is the best way of figuring out what to induct on.</p>

QUESTION: Hypothetically, let us say that our Induction hypothesis was something like &#34;Assume that the claim holds for some n=k, where k is a positive integer. In other words (specific claim)&#34; When writing the Induction Step, we say something like &#34; We will show that the claim holds for n=k&#43;1.&#34; Do we need to specify here that k&#43;1 is also a positive integer?
ANSWER: It’s not necessary

QUESTION: I am trying to solve this problem a different way than the solution. Can I assume that the number of multiplications necessary to multiply k elements with NO parenthesis is k-1 just by basic algebra?
ANSWER: sure

QUESTION: <p></p>
<p>the solutions are assuming that it’s a connected graph. what line in the problem statement makes us reach to that conclusion?</p>
<p></p>
<p>“there exists a walkway between ANY two sections” not every and not &#34;ALWAYS exists&#34;<br /><br />Moreover, in the solution it says &#34; we know that EVERY section in S has a walkway to D&#34; . Doesn&#39;t this mean that it is a complete graph? (every section is connected to every other section) =&gt; where is the specified in the question, though?</p>
ANSWER: <p>The solution never models the question as a graph.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, in general, by definition, a graph is connected if between every pair of vertices, there is a path connecting them. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Should you choose to model this question as a graph, you&#39;d have to be a bit careful because the edges wouldn&#39;t be undirected (since there are one-way walkways).</p>

QUESTION: In lecture 3H, example 2, why can&#39;t the procedure for allocating the n distinct objects to k bins be:<br />1. Choose a bin for object 1.<br />2. Choose a bin for object 2<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />n. Choose a bin for object n?
ANSWER: The problem assumes that for bin $$b_i$$ you need to have $$n_i$$ objects in it. With your procedure, you wouldn&#39;t be guaranteeing this.

QUESTION: <p>I understand why the explanation in the solutions is correct, but how is the following procedure overcounting?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Step 1. Choose 3 books: $$5 \choose 3$$ ways</p>
<p>Step 2. Distribute 3 books among 3 students: $$3!$$ ways</p>
<p>Step 3. Choose 2 people for the 2 remaining books: $$3 \choose 2$$ ways</p>
<p>Step 4. Distribute the 2 books: 2 ways</p>
<p></p>
<p>I get 360 instead of the correct answer of 150, but I don&#39;t see where I went wrong. </p>
ANSWER: <p>Consider the following two sets of actions that could be performed by your procedure:</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Procedure 1</span>:</p>
<p>- Step 1: Choose books B, C, D</p>
<p>- Step 2: Give Anne book B, Mary book C, and Dan book D</p>
<p>- Step 3: Choose Anne and Mary</p>
<p>- Step 4: Give Anne book A and Mary book E.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Procedure 2:</span></p>
<p>- Step 1: Choose books A, D, E</p>
<p>- Step 2: Give Anne book A, Mary book E, and Dan book D.</p>
<p>- Step 3: Choose Anne and Mary</p>
<p>- Step 4: Give Anne book B and Mary book C.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since we got the same result by following your procedure in two distinct ways, you are overcounting.</p>

QUESTION: For this question, why is it 13 choose 1 if we want a four of a kind so four cards. Shouldn&#39;t it be 13 choose 4 and then 48 choose 1 to get a hand with five cards? or am I misunderstanding the question?
ANSWER: 4-of-a-kind means that we need four cards that have the same value. So if there are 13 total values, we should choose which one of them we want the four-of-a-kind to be designated with

QUESTION: For this question, can someone explain why we are doing 4 choose 3 instead of just doing 13 choose 3 and then 12 choose 2? 
ANSWER: <p>Here&#39;s the full procedure. Note that there are 13 values and 4 suits.</p>
<p><br />Step 1) Choose which value will create the four-of-a-kind</p>
<p>Step 2) Choose which suits will be represented by the value chosen in the prior step.</p>
<p>Step 3) Choose the remaining two values for the last two cards (must be distinct values)</p>
<p>Step 4) Choose the suits for each of the remaining cards.</p>

ANSWER: I&#39;m not quite sure what you mean by this, but in the base case, you generally should be testing the smallest value allowed by the domain/bounds in a question

QUESTION: why does the solution say that z &gt;= 143 is clearly not true? why can&#39;t it be true?
ANSWER: if $$z$$ is divisible by 143, then so is $$z - 143$$. And if $$z \geq 143$$, then $$z -143 \geq 0$$, which would be a smaller example

QUESTION: When do we use curly brackets vs parentheses when defining elements of the sample space? I know it has to do with whether or not order matters, but I am confused in which case to use what.
ANSWER: <p>$$\{\}$$ is for defining a set. And in sets, the order does not matter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$()$$ is used to define tuples/sequences, and the order matters</p>

QUESTION: <p>A closed path (cycle) is not a path, right? I think it would not be since it repeats the first node, and paths can&#39;t have repeats, but its also called a closed *path* so I wanted to make sure. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Also, just to confirm, a walk is any sort of path/closed path/repeated elements or any way to just get from one node to another, right? </p>
ANSWER: <p>yeah we don&#39;t really call cycles paths. </p>
<p></p>
<p>yes to the second question</p>

QUESTION: I completely understand the solution for question 4 but I don&#39;t understand what class concept it was testing us on, and would like to know so that I can ensure I can study it for the midterm. I remember when I did the homework I just thought about it for kind of a while.
ANSWER: Since this was early on in the semester, this wasn’t particularly testing a specific concept, but more so trying to get you in the “problem solving” mindset, which is an important thing to have for this course

QUESTION: Instead of taking all possible parities of m and n, can we use the fact that m^2 is a multiple of 6 to show that m is a multiple of 6, which will eventually lead us to n being a multiple of 6?

QUESTION: For <em>j </em>in the strong induction induction hypothesis, I had a deduction for not explicitly stating that &#34;<em>j </em>is an integer&#34;. However, in other solutions i.e. lecture material, <em>j </em>being an integer was not explicitly stated even in situations where <em>j</em> must be an integer. In what situations is it necessary to state that<em> j </em>is an integer?
ANSWER: You’re technically always supposed to state the domain, but in this class we usually let it slide. You should not have been deducted for this, so feel free to attend OH today to get an endorsement for a regrade request

QUESTION: <p style="text-align:left">In lecture, the process for finding the number of 8-letter strings with 3 vowels was described as follows:</p>

<ul><li>First, choose the positions for the vowels ([8 choose 3] ways)</li><li>Next, choose the vowels for each position (5^3 ways)</li><li>Next, choose the consonants for the remaining positions (21^5 ways)</li></ul>
<p>Total = (8 choose 3)*(5^3)*(21^5) = 28588707000</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why would it be wrong instead to:</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>First, choose the vowels to include: (5 choose 3)</li><li>Next, choose the consonants to include (21 choose 5)</li><li>Order the letters (8! ways)</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p>Total = (5 choose 3)*(21 choose 5)*(8!) = 8204716800</p>

QUESTION: For Q4 on the practice exam, I understand that it is a PHP problem. However, I do not understand the algebraic expressions ai = nq &#43; r and aj = nq&#39; &#43; r. What does the overall algebra signify, and what does q and q&#39; represent? 
ANSWER: <p>We say that an integer $$a$$ has remainder $$r$$ when divided by some integer $$n$$ if we can write $$a = nq + r$$ for some integer $$q$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>So in your question, $$q, q' \in \mathbb Z$$</p>

<p>For example, if the question is prove: (n choose k) = (n-1 choose k-1) &#43; (n-1 choose k), can we just say, this is proven as this is pascal&#39;s triangle and this was done in lecture?</p>

QUESTION: My solution different from the solution given, where my answer was 3^5 - 3 - ((3 choose 2) * 2^5), whereas the solution had 2^5 - 2. Where is the &#34;-2&#34; coming from? 
ANSWER: Just having $$2^5$$ does not ensure that the books are distributed to two students such that each student gets at least one. That is, in all steps of the procedure that creates $$2^5$$, you could have given each book to the same person, which isn&#39;t allowed in this case, because we want only one person to not have any books.

ANSWER: <p>The induction hypothesis is assuming that the first player has a winning strategy if $$n \neq 4k + 1$$ AND if $$n \neq 4k + 1$$ then the first player has a winning strategy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We can use the contrapositive on the first part of the IH to assume that if $$n = 4k + 1$$ then the first player does not have a winning strategy AND if $$n \neq 4k + 1$$ then the first player does have a winning strategy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In case 1, we utilize the first part of the IH and in case 2 we utilize the second part. </p>

QUESTION: Theoretically, if a question were to appear on the exam where a method learned past Lecture 6T could be applied (i.e. conditional probability), would an answer using such a method receive full credit?
ANSWER: Yeah

QUESTION: Is the amount of space we have to write our solution just the one page on which the question is printed? Can we request for more sheets incase we run out of space? 
ANSWER: You will have a front and back page for nearly every question

QUESTION: How do you write the contrapositive of a biconditional statement? For example, we solved the following problem from Recitation 2 using contrapositive:<br /><br />Let m and n be two integers. Prove that mn &#43; m is odd if and only if m is odd and n is even.<br /><br /><br />
ANSWER: <p>Remember that a biconditional is the conjunction of two implications. That is, $$p \iff q \equiv p \implies q \land q \implies p$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When proving a biconditional, we have to prove both directions. That is, we show that both $$p \implies q$$ AND $$q \implies p$$ holds.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To prove $$p \implies q$$, for example, you could choose to do it directly, or you could do it by contrapositive if you wish. That is, you could prove $$\lnot q \implies \lnot p$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Contrapositive only applies for an implication.</p>

QUESTION: <p>&#34;When three dice are rolled what is the probability that one of the dice results in 4?&#34;<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>When a question says &#34;one of the,&#34; is it always asking &#34;at least one&#34; instead of &#34;only 1&#34;?</p>
ANSWER: usually it will mean &#34;at least one&#34;

QUESTION: How do we know z &lt; r &lt; y?<br /><br />Additionally, was there any method to coming up with what r is?
ANSWER: <p>If $$r = \frac{z + y}{2}$$ and $$z < y $$ then $$r > \frac{z + z}{2} = z$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Similarly, $$r = \frac{z+y}{2} < \frac{y+y}{2} = y$$. So that&#39;s how we conclude $$z < r < y$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The logic for coming up with $$r$$ is that we wanted to yield a contradiction, and given that we defined $$z$$ to be the largest rational number in the interval, we were aiming to find something larger than $$z$$ that still falls within the interval. So the natural choices is the average between $$z$$ and the upper bound.</p>

QUESTION: are we allowed to use one in the exam
ANSWER: No

QUESTION: In general, how do you know when to use stars and bars vs when to use the equation for the permutations of a multiset?
ANSWER: <p>Stars and bars is used to distribute indistinguishable items to distinguishable containers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Permutations of a multiset is used to count the amount of ways to &#34;arrange&#34; or permute a grouping of items where repetitions are allowed (that is, there isn&#39;t much of a notion of &#34;distribution&#34;).</p>

QUESTION: <p>For Q7, I provided an alternate solution to using strong induction to prove that any string of length n could be written in the form x = y \cdot z. For the induction hypothesis, I wrote that &#34;Assume the claim holds true for 0 is less than or equal to j is less than or equal to k&#34; for some integer k greater than or equal to 0 and all integers j in the range. That is, a string of length j can be written in the form x = y \cdot z&#34;. For the induction step, I partitioned the string of length k&#43;1 into two nonempty binary strings of length a and b. Since 0 is less than or equal to a, b is less than or equal to k, the induction hypothesis could be used to say that both strings could be written as concatenation. Since in both strings, the number of 0&#39;s in y is equal to the number of 1&#39;s in z, a string of length k&#43;1 can be written as concatenation such that the number of 0&#39;s in y is equal to the number of 1&#39;s in z (by way of adding the values). Thus, the induction step is proven.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was wondering if this solution works for the proof.</p>
ANSWER: I don&#39;t think this is quite right. Because if you split $$x = y \cdot z$$ and then apply the IH on $$y$$ and $$z$$ then you have $$x = (p_1 \cdot q_1) \cdot (p_2 \cdot q_2)$$ where the number of 0s in $$p_i$$ is equal to the number of $$1$$s in $$q_i$$. But how does this help solve the original claim? We cannot &#34;combine&#34; $$p_1$$ and $$p_2$$ because they are non-contiguous.

ANSWER: Yep this is a mistake. Just add another vertex which is adjacent to any one of the three leaves and that graph would work.

QUESTION: The solution uses PIE, but why would the answer C(8,3)* 3! * 3^5 not work? (Choosing 3 flyers to give to the freshmen at first, arranging them, and then choosing out of 3 options for each of the 5 remaining flyers)
ANSWER: <p>Suppose you did have the following procedure:</p>
<p>Step 1) Choose 3 of the 8 flyers</p>
<p>Step 2) arrange the flyers</p>
<p>Step 3) Assign each of the remaining flyers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then consider the following two ways of following the procedure:</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Procedure 1:</span></p>
<p>Step 1) Choose flyers 1, 2, 3.</p>
<p>Step 2) Permute them, and say the permutation is 1, 2, 3. (i.e. person A gets flyer 1, person B gets flyer 2, person C gets flyer 3).</p>
<p>Step 3) Suppose we give flyers 4 through 8 to person A.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the end of the procedure, person A has flyers 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, person B has flyer 2 and person C has flyer 3.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Procedure 2:</span></p>
<p>Step 1) Choose flyers 2, 3, 4.</p>
<p>Step 2) Permute them, and say the permutation is 4, 2, 3 (i.e. person A gets flyer 4, person B gets flyer 2, person C gets flyer 3).</p>
<p>Step 3) Suppose give the remaining flyers all to person A.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the end of the procedure, person A has flyers 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, person B has flyer 2 and person C has flyer 3.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thus, we have ended with the same state by following the procedure in two different ways, so the procedure overcounts :(</p>

QUESTION: Hi, I&#39;m so sorry that this is such a strange question, but I&#39;m in recitation 202 and I remember one of my TA&#39;s names was Cindy, but I had forgotten the other TA&#39;s name. I went on the CIS 1600 Staff page and found the other TA&#39;s name to be Shaurya (which is what I think he introduced himself as), but the CIS Schedule tab says that Rec 202 is run by Cindy &amp; Sid. I&#39;m really confused and I feel super bad not knowing his name 2 months into the semester, but I&#39;m pretty bad with names and just wanted some clarification so as not to lose easy points tomorrow.

QUESTION: &#34;a set S containing homes of neighborhood 1&#34;, Does that mean nodes adjacent to some node labelled as 1 and 2, or rather neighbourhood 1 as one community (set of homes which are connected called as community 1) ? 
ANSWER: <p>&#34;Harish wants to make two neighborhoods by partitioning all the homes into two<br />non-empty sets&#34;</p>
<p></p>
<p>So Harish is going to decide which homes are in which neighborhood, and this decision will define what the partition looks like. Therefore, you cannot tell what neighborhood a home belongs to based off of which neighborhood another home that is connected to it by a road belongs to</p>

QUESTION: <p>Dear CIS 1600 instructors,</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am writing to you to clarify a mistake made on behalf of one of our team members in homework 9T. Advit Ranawade, Angela Zhang and I formed a collaboration group for the 7H homework. For the 9T homework, Advit, Angela and I met through Zoom on Wednesday to go over our approaches for each problem. Angela and I understood that this was collaboration, and we assumed that the collaboration group remained the same as in homework 7H. Advit has not shown us his submitted homework, but he has made us aware that it does not include both of our names. He did not inform us about any of this prior to submission, so Angela and I submitted each other and Advit as collaborators. Angela and I sent you this message as soon as we learned of his mistake.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are extremely sorry for the error. We understand that, per the collaboration policy, we would get a zero for this homework. Granted that we tried to notify you at the earliest possible time, and before the homework is graded, we sincerely hope that we can be given some leniency this one time. We truly feel like we were blindsided.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you for your attention,</p>
<p></p>
<p>Andrea Gonzalez Varela and Angela Zhang</p>
ANSWER: <p>Hi, thank you for letting us know about this, and thank you for your patience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This time, we are willing to let this go with a warning. Such a warning is that if another mistake like this occurs in the future, you will suffer a penalty on the homework(s). Please aim to be vigilant about collaboration from now onwards.</p>

QUESTION: <p>Dear Teachers, </p>
<p></p>
<p>I am writing this note to sincerely apologize for an error I made in submitting the names of my collaborators for HW9T. As Angie and Andrea informed, I did not put their names as collaborators and am sorry for missing out on this. Including them, I have three collaborators, which I understand violates the policy. <br /><br />I am well aware of the collaboration policy and am willing to accept any applicable penalizations on this homework. However, I would humbly request you&#39;ll to consider that this was a miscommunication on my end and I did not have any intentions of malpractice. I am really sorry for the confusion and in retrospect I should have paid closer attention before collaborating with 3. This incident was an isolated occurence and a result of lapse in judgement on my part, though I can assure you that I have and will remain steadfastly commited to the code of integrity for the duration of this course.</p>
<p>Thank you for your considerations. <br /><br />With warm regards, <br />Advit </p>
ANSWER: <p>Hello, thank you for letting us know and thank you for your patience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Due to the violation of the collaboration policy, we have incurred a 10 point deduction on your HW9T. Any further violation of the policy will yield a much more significant penalty. Please aim to be vigilant about the collaboration policy from now onwards.</p>

QUESTION: Can LOE not be applied to question 5 because the summation is not finite? It is part of the theorem statement in the lecture notes
ANSWER: Linearity of expectation does hold ad infinitum with certain conditions. However, this extends beyond the scope of this class. So you should only be applying LOE on finite collections of random variables.

QUESTION: &#34;Sam decides to challenge Alex to a game, and gives her one coin. In each round, Alex will hide the coin below one of the 50 pumpkins and bet some amount of money. Sam will choose a pumpkin uniformly at random, and if Alex’s coin is below that pumpkin, Sam will pay Alex so that she makes a net profit of 47 times his initial bet. If Alex’s coin is not below the pumpkin Sam chose, Alex will lose her initial bet.&#34;<br /><br />I am confused about Sam paying Alex &#34;so that she makes a net profit of 47 times his initial bet&#34;. At this point, the only person that has made a bet is Alex but the question says that Alex gains 47 times Sam&#39;s bet?

QUESTION: <p>Hi, doesn&#39;t the problem allow the root to have a degree of 1, and if so, doesn&#39;t the proposition not hold?</p>
<p><img src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fllwe7wpaill6br%2Fb7f59b683dc3b054ba5414d927cf25a5bb5d3d5015fc912f0ced5a860da3ccac%2FIMG_243293C75864-1.jpeg" alt="" width="404" height="356" /></p>
ANSWER: <p>the problem doesn&#39;t really mention anything about a root. regardless, the root having degree 1 also means that it is a leaf. so your left tree has 3 leaves and (3-2) = 1 vertex of degree 3 and your right tree has 4 leaves and (4-2) = 2 vertices of degree 3, so the proposition does hold in these examples.</p>

QUESTION: In question 4, the question states &#34;there is at most one candy path connecting any two haunted houses.&#34; Does this not imply that there is not a cycle in the graph of haunted houses? If so, how can we prove that there is a cycle?
ANSWER: <p>no. this still allows for someone to get from one haunted house to another via some intermediary haunted houses. It&#39;s just that if we are looking for a &#34;direct&#34; connection between a pair of haunted houses, there is either 0 or 1 candy paths connecting them.</p>

QUESTION: how exactly do we define a cyclic tree? ie what exactly constitutes as a cycle? could we use something along the lines of &#34;if a node can reach another node using more than 1 path&#34;? 
ANSWER: <p>trees, by definition, do not have cycles, so there is no such thing as a cyclic tree. </p>
<p></p>
<p>A cycle is defined as a closed path -- a sequence of vertices connected by edges such that all vertices are distinct except for the first and the last. </p>

QUESTION: Don&#39;t two leaves with the same adjacent vertex share the same &#34;set of neighbors&#34;? And each adjacent vertex has at least two leaves since it&#39;s an acyclic tree. I feel like I&#39;m missing something.
ANSWER: <p>a tree does not imply that every internal vertex has at least two leaves. You may be thinking of the theorem that &#34;every connected tree has at least two leaves&#34; which is a bit different than what you are claiming</p>

QUESTION: In Q1, when it states that &#34;every meatball v ∈ V is connected to other meatballs via noodles&#34; does that mean that there is a noodle between every pair of meatballs or there is a path of noodles between every pair of meatballs?
ANSWER: <p>EDIT: path of noodles</p>
<p></p>
<p>cheers</p>

QUESTION: Is there a minimum number of meatball edges?

QUESTION: Is the question saying that every edge that belongs to T does not belong to T’? Or for such an edge if it exists, prove the claim? 
ANSWER: <p>No, you are told that $$T$$ and $$T'$$ are distinct, but this does not mean that $$E \cap E' = \emptyset$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>You need to show that for <em>any</em> and <em>every</em> edge that is found in $$E \setminus E'$$, that we can find some other edge in $$E' \setminus E$$ that abides by the claim.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In other words, for every edge found in $$T$$ that is not found in $$T'$$, we can find some edge in $$T'$$ that is not in $$T$$ such that the claim holds.</p>

QUESTION: If we originally have n - 1 edges. Do we have to prove that by removing and edge and adding another edge back to the graph, we end up with a graph with n - 1 edges again?
ANSWER: <p>no</p>
<p></p>
<p>cheers</p>

QUESTION: Do I have to prove that removing an edge from a tree creates a graph with exactly two connected components?
ANSWER: <p>no, you can assume that this follows from the fact that trees are minimally connected</p>
<p></p>
<p>cheers</p>

QUESTION: Does T = (V,E), T′ = (V,E′) mean that it contains all the vertices that T does and contains all the edges that T does not. Or can they have common edges?
ANSWER: <p>the vertex sets are the same, but they are allowed to have common edges, but not all edges can be the same since you are told that $$T$$ and $$T'$$ are distinct</p>
<p></p>
<p>cheers</p>

QUESTION: <p>Do I have to prove that if I remove an edge from a cycle, then the graph that contains the cycle is still connected? </p>
<p></p>
<p>If so, how would I do this?</p>
ANSWER: <p>i&#39;m not really sure what you mean. it depends on what the original graph is. but also like after you remove an edge it may remove the cycle?</p>
<p></p>
<p>you should think about how to prove this on your own</p>
<p></p>
<p>cheers</p>

<p></p>
<p>For example, I own many pairs of socks, so if someone asks me &#34;do you own a pair of socks&#34;, I would answer yes.</p>

QUESTION: Hello, if there are only 2 random variables are pairwise and mutual independence the same? Thanks.
ANSWER: Yes. Mutual independence ensures that for every subset of random variables, the probability of their intersection equals the product of their individual probabilities. When the amount of random variables is 2, the only &#34;subset&#34; that is interesting is the subset containing the two rvs. This is equivalent to pairwise independence.

QUESTION: Can we just assume there are at least two paths going from one vertex to the other in an Eulerian circuit, and these paths partition the Eulerian circuit?(This can be shown easily with a diagram. This is also proved in my recitation.)

QUESTION: <p>&#34;Shaurya can distinguish between a black bean and a pinto bean, but he can’t tell any pair of black beans apart, and he can’t tell any pair of pinto beans apart either.&#34;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Does it mean that if there is a pair of black beans, then he doesn&#39;t know that they&#39;re black beans?</p>
ANSWER: <p>no, it just means he cannot differentiate between two black beans. That is, suppose the black beans had names, like &#34;Bob&#34; and &#34;Ishaan&#34;. Then Shaurya, just by looking at the beans, wouldn&#39;t be able to tell which black bean is Bob and which one is Ishaan.</p>
<p></p>
<p>in other words, they are indistinguishable </p>

QUESTION: If a theorem has been mentioned in class without any derivation, could we use it in proofs and other problems?
ANSWER: Yep, just be sure to cite where it was proved in class

QUESTION: <p>For this problem I know that we need to use an indicator variable, because the sum of 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s, where 1&#39;s indicate that a given bean is a pinto bean, can give us the total number of pinto beans in the spoon. However, I&#39;m having trouble determining how to find the probability that a bean is a pinto bean, since we are scooping up multiple beans, so if one of the beans is a pinto bean, then the probability that another bean in the spoon is a pinto bean is less, because there is 1 less bean to choose from and 1 less pinto bean as well. Could I get a little bit of guidance about how to avoid this problem? </p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
ANSWER: Recall that the probability is directly related to how you define your indicators. If you are finding that your current definition of indicators is yielding unwieldy probabilities, then it may be worthwhile to redefine your indicators in a way that yields more pleasant probabilities all while still solving the same question

QUESTION: For the birthday paradox question, why is the answer for the probability of B = 1 − P(n, k) / n^k? I don&#39;t understand why we are permuting over k? 
ANSWER: <p>the numerator is counting the number of ways we could have $$k$$ people with different birthdays. consider the following procedure:</p>
<p></p>
<p>step 1: assign a birthday for first person (n ways)</p>
<p>step 2: assign birthday for second person (n-1 ways)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>step k: assign birthday for kth person (n-k&#43;1 ways)</p>

QUESTION: I&#39;m a little confused about how we got the numbers for Pr[A] and Pr[A union B]. Can someone help clarify these? Thank you!<img src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fky949208tq6ks%2Fafb097270357b5cb9afeb99ede184846f366c3dbcdc357e155262d2df0cd0c80%2FScreen_Shot_2023-11-10_at_8.15.18_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2023-11-10_at_8.15.18_PM.pngNaN" />
ANSWER: <p>For Pr[A], a simple explanation is to just consider the first card in your hand that has value V. From the remaining 51 cards, only 3 of them have value V, so the probability that the second card matches the value is 3/51.</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$A \cap B$$ describes the event when the first card is an Ace and the first two cards have the same value. That is, both the first and second card must be Aces. A deck of cards has 4 distinct Aces, so there are $$\binom{4}{2}$$ ways to have 2 aces in the first two cards. the denominator counts the total number of first two cards we could have</p>

QUESTION: In class, we have accepted some open-form answers for expectation calculations (e.g., in the case of infinite series). However, as in HW 9H #6, sometimes these open-form solutions simplify with clever manipulation. We were discussing this topic in office hours, and did not come to a clear answer to the following question. To confirm, would we lose points in the exam if our open-form answer was correct, but was not fully simplified (in some non-trivial way)?
ANSWER: Here&#39;s the best answer I can provide: The problems on the midterm will not be designed for you to get an answer and have a <em>required</em> extra step to make it closed form.

QUESTION: For the practice exam, a lot of the questions (Q1, Q4) did not have a sample space explicitly defined. If we were to explain our solution exactly how the solutions for the practice exam explains them, would we have points taken off on the actual exam?<br /><br />Q6 references a uniform sample space but does not define it. Similarly, can we do the same?
ANSWER: You will be explicitly told on the exam whether or not a defined sample space is needed for the problem

QUESTION: <p>I believe we’ve defined if the sum of two numbers are even, then the numbers themselves are both even/odd. Similarly, the contrapositive is true.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Do we have to prove (albeit it being simple) the converse for any proof going forward? If the numbers are both odd/even, then the sum is even? We haven’t explicitly proved this in class.<br /><br /></p>
<p>It would make it simple to say that if we add/subtract an edge to an odd degree vertex, then the resulting new degree is even.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
ANSWER: <p>you can assume basically everything involving addition/subtraction/multiplication of integers. That is, feel free to assume the following:</p>

QUESTION: If I have a connected graph with n vertices and m edges, and I manipulate it but by the end of my manipulation it still has n vertices and m edges, can I say that it is still a connected graph? If yes, why is that true? If no, why not? 
ANSWER: <p>wait I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &#34;manipulate&#34;. Like if &#34;manipulate&#34; entails replacing an edge with a different edge, then no. Because I can start with a connected graph on, say 6 vertices and 6 edges, and replace some edges and result in a disconnected graph.</p>
<p></p>
<p>i may be able to provide a more helpful answer if you expand on what you mean by &#34;manipulate&#34;</p>

QUESTION: Are Eulerian or Hamiltonian graphs connected by definition, or can they be disconnected graphs as well?
ANSWER: This is something you should really try to determine on your own. Remember that, for example, a Hamiltonian graph has a hamiltonian cycle that traverses all the vertices. Is this possible for a disconnected graph?

<p>Does the statement &#34;A vertex of degree 1 belongs to no path connecting two vertices other than v&#34; mean that a vertex of degree 1 can only be on one path?</p>
ANSWER: no, it just means that every path containing $$v$$ must be a path that has endpoint $$v$$

QUESTION: To prove if G is a tree then G is connected and has exactly n-1 edges, why can&#39;t we use that #CC&#39;s $$\geq$$ n-m? Since we know #CC&#39;s is exactly 1, 1 =n-m so m=n-1.
ANSWER: the equation is $$C \geq n - m$$, so with $$C = 1$$, you have $$1 \geq n - m$$, or equivalently, $$m \geq n-1$$, but this is not strict equality

QUESTION: <p>Hello, I have an alternate solution for number 3 on HW 10T and I wanted to check if it works. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Essentially, We know that the expected value of X equals summation of i Pr[X=i] where i goes from 1 through 6. I first calculated the probability that X=i as follows: </p>
<p></p>
<p>The sample space is all possible combinations of dice rolls that we can have, which has a cardinality of 6^4. </p>
<p>The event is the number of ways that i can be the largest value. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Essentially, there are 4 cases here whose probability we can add by TPT: Case 1 is that there is 1 die with value i. Case 2 is that there are 2 die with value i. Case 3 is that there are 3 die with value i. Case 4 is that all 4 die have value i. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Case 1: The number of ways to have 4 dice rolls result in the largest number being i with exactly 1 die that has value i is (4 choose 1)*(i-1)^3, since we choose 1 of the 4 die to have value i, and then each of the other 3 dice have i-1 options for numbers because we need i to be the largest. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Case 2: Similarly, number of ways to have 4 dice rolls result in the largest number being i with exactly 2 dice with value is (4 choose 2) * (i-1)^2. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Case 3: exactly 3 dice with value i -&gt; (4 choose 3)(i-1)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Case 4: exactly 4 dice with value i -&gt; 1 </p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, the total probability of some roll of the 4 dice having a max value of i is ((4 choose 1)*(i-1)^3 &#43; (4 choose 2) * (i-1)^2 &#43; (4 choose 3)(i-1) &#43; 1) / 6^4= (4(i-1)^3 &#43; 6(i-1)^2 &#43; 4(i-1) &#43; 1)/ 6^4</p>
<p></p>
<p>We can then put this in the summation from i equals 1 to 6. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Could you please let me know if this works? Thanks. </p>
ANSWER: yep this seems fine to me

QUESTION: <p>Hello, I did problem 2 a little bit differently here. Why does this not give me the correct answer? </p>
<p></p>
<p>Here, we are trying to find the probability that we get 4 heads and that those for heads are situated such that they form a square. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Let X be the event that we get four heads and Y be the event that those heads are situated such that they form a square. </p>
<p></p>
<p>We essentially want to find Pr[X and Y], which is Pr[X]Pr[Y|X]. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Pr[X] is (9 choose 4) times (1/2)^9 </p>
<p></p>
<p>Pr[Y|X] is simply the probability that our 4 selected spots form a 2x2 grid. The sample space is all the ways to select 4, which is (9 choose 4), and the number of ways to form a 2 by 2 grid is simply 4. Therefore, we have Pr[Y|X]= 4/126, and Pr[X] = 126/512 = 1/2. </p>
<p></p>
<p>When I multiply these, I get 4/252, which is not equal to 9/512. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I think I somewhat know what is wrong but I don&#39;t know how to fix it. Firstly, I think I might be double counting for order by multiplying by 9 choose 4 when finding P[X]. However, removing this doesn&#39;t give me the right answer either. Additionally, it might not be possible to define Y the way I did, since we can&#39;t just say the probability that any 4 randomly selected coins forms a square without knowing what the coins are, in which case we couldn&#39;t find P[Y]. I&#39;m not sure how else to define Y though. I know we can do this using PIE, but I&#39;m wondering if my method could work here by maybe redefining variables and calculating probability another way. If not, why not? </p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks in advance. </p>

QUESTION: <md>Maybe trivial question but suppose it is explicitly mentioned to use Chebyshev's inequality to bound a certain event. Can we use X-E[X], square both sides, and apply our Markov as we did in homework and just stating it is Chebyshev? 

Because in recitation 11 it is not done in that way, and long procedure is followed before we could apply Chebyshev.</md>
ANSWER: <p>You are free to use Chebyshev whenever and however you want.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The reason why Chebyshev wasn&#39;t immediately used in reci 11 is because we were not super interested in finding a bound of $$| X - \mathbb{E}[X] |$$ especially because $$\mathbb{E}[X] \neq 0$$. We were trying to bound $$\Pr[X \geq a]$$, so we had to do a bit of massaging to chebyshev to get it into the form that we wanted.</p>

QUESTION: Can an independent set in G be part of a larger independent set? Or is G already split into the minimum number of independent sets? 
ANSWER: The answer to the first question is yes. A derivative of the conclusion of your question is that if you have an independent set of size, say, 4, then you also have an independent set of size 3. But the converse is not necessarily true

QUESTION: I was reviewing Lecture 12T, and I was wondering why the &#34;less than or equal to&#34; and &#34;less than&#34; symbols demonstrate antisymmetric relations. 
ANSWER: <p>It is true that $$\leq$$ is an antisymmetric relation. This is because $$\forall a, b \in \mathbb Z$$ if we have $$a \leq b$$ and $$b \leq a$$ (which is the precondition for an antisymmetric relation), then it must be the case that $$a = b$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When it comes to $$<$$, you&#39;ll note that it is not possible to have $$a < b$$ AND $$b < a$$ for elements $$a, b$$, so the precondition holds vacuously</p>

QUESTION: Could someone please explain the above. I understand all the other relations except for these? Thank you!
ANSWER: <p>For R4 being anti-symmetric, see @1391.</p>
<p></p>
<p>R5 is antisymmetric because suppose we have $$a \mid b$$ and $$b \mid a$$ for $$a, b \in \mathbb Z^+$$. Then, since $$a \mid b$$, we have $$b = k \cdot a$$ for some integer $$k$$, and for $$b \mid a$$, we have $$a = \ell \cdot b$$ for some integer $$\ell$$. Substituting, we get $$b = k \cdot (\ell \cdot b)$$, which means that we must have $$k \cdot \ell = 1$$, or $$k = \ell = 1$$, since $$k$$ and $$\ell$$ are both integers. Then, it must be the case that $$a = b$$ which means it is antisymmetric.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To verify that R6 is transitive, we need, for $$x, y, z \in \mathbb Z$$ that if $$x \mid y$$ and $$y \mid z$$, then $$z \mid a$$. Starting with the precondition of $$x \mid y$$, we have that $$y = k \cdot x$$ for some integer $$k$$. Similarly, $$y \mid z$$ tells us $$z = \ell \cdot y$$. Substituting, we have $$z = \ell \cdot (k \cdot x) = (\ell \cdot k) \cdot x$$. We know that $$\ell$$ and $$k$$ are both integers, so $$\ell \cdot k$$ must also be. Then, by definition, we have $$x \mid z$$, so transitivity holds</p>

QUESTION: I&#39;m a bit confused by the wording on this question. Can experienced TAs &#34;vibe with&#34; the same new TA? I&#39;m interpreting the question as each individual experienced TA has a set of m distinct new TAs that they vibe with.
ANSWER: A single experienced TA can &#34;vibe with&#34; a single new TA <em>at most once.</em>

QUESTION: Is vibing symmetric? I.e: if experienced TA a vibes w/ new TA b, must b vibe w/ a?
ANSWER: somehow yes, even though this doesn&#39;t carry over to the real world (anecdotal evidence)

QUESTION: I was recreating the lecture notes for Lec 11T and wondered, instead of saying $$R_5$$ is a relation on $$A \cup B$$, can we not use a &#34;stricter&#34; relation to claim that it is a relation from $$A \cup B$$ to $$B$$?
ANSWER: you could. and it would be valid in this case since $$R_5 \subseteq (A \cup B) \times B$$

QUESTION: <p style="text-align:left">In the following proof in Lect 13T, to prove the converse implication, we are assuming that R as a relation containing all possible pairs (x, y) ... exists. How can we assume this? Secondly, why would x and y need to be in the same subset Ai of the partition?  <img src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fllx1rx3o8vy240%2F5222848dc65c51d7fe2487d6056aaa62320d4ad403169b6a473b43c7033c75dc%2Fimage.png" alt="image.pngNaN" /></p>
ANSWER: It&#39;s not really an assumption we are making, but rather a definition. The converse is asking us to show existence of a relation $$R$$, so we choose to define it in the way provided.

QUESTION: <p>Can we use a combinatorial approach to prove equality in situations which do not involve permutations or selections of any kind, but instead, count up a common quantity in two different ways to obtain LHS and RHS?</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am asking this because I have never used them out of the context of explicitly being asked to do so, and would not want to lose points in case I applied it to a situation where it was not expected. </p>
ANSWER: sure. combinatorial proofs are meant to be used to prove equality. so you can use them as you wish.

QUESTION: For this theorem that we proved in lecture: Let R be an equivalence relation on a set A. Then the set {[a]R | a ∈ A} is a partition of the set A. Each element of the set is called an equivalence class of R. Are all these equivalence classes distinct from each other? 
ANSWER: yes

QUESTION: In the lecture notes for 14t, we prove that every graph with a certain minimum degree has a dominating set of size at most some value relative to n and the minimum degree. However, how can that be true, when technically the set of all n nodes is a valid dominating set? Furthermore, how would the probabilistic method prove that the dominating set is at most that value?
ANSWER: <p>You proved that any connected graph with $$n \geq 2$$ vertices and min degree $$\delta(G) = \delta$$ contains a dominating set of size at most $$\frac{n(1 + \ln(1 + \delta))}{1 + \delta}$$. In the example you are describing, we have $$\delta = 0$$, so substituting, we get $$\frac{n(1 + \ln(1 + 0)}{1 + 0} = \frac{n(1 + \ln(1)}{1} = \frac{n(1 + 0)}{1} = n$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So it still works.</p>

QUESTION: In class, we have applied Hall&#39;s Theorem to matchings connecting one point of one set with one point of the other set. Suppose we want to extend Hall&#39;s theorem to matchings of one point of one set to x points of the other set. In this case, since we will have to undercount the vertices of the other set and consider them as individual entities, we would have to prove that |A| \leq \frac{|N_G(A)}{x}?
ANSWER: hmm interesting question. I&#39;ll think more about it. But one easy way of tackling this problem would be to just apply Hall&#39;s theorem once to get a matching, then remove all of the edges in the matching, apply Hall&#39;s theorem to the resulting graph, and so on and so forth $$x$$ times. If Hall&#39;s condition is satisfied every time, then you have found the desired structure

QUESTION: How would we justify for this direction that M&#39; is a matching in G?<img src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fllxqtee94r59n%2F9a4978ad7f42a7a6eaa5053aebb34d6a3d89560e385211272e12a1ba6fbebbd9%2FScreen_Shot_2023-12-14_at_5.34.40_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2023-12-14_at_5.34.40_PM.pngNaN" />
ANSWER: Since in an $$M$$-augmenting path, the edges alternate between what is in $$M$$ and what is not, when we take the complement (to get $$M'$$), the path also alternates between $$M'$$ edges. None of these edges share an endpoint, so it is a matching.

<p>I had a similar process where I started off with 1 - Pr[N &gt;= 6], and, in order to first get Pr[N &gt;= 6] in terms of Chebyshev&#39;s formula, I subtracted E[N] from both sides to get to Pr[N - E[N] &gt;= 6 - E[N]], where I believe we substitute in 9(8/9)^10 for E[N], thus resulting in 6 - 9(8/9)^10 for the &#34;a&#34; value. However, the solution only shows 6 - (8/9)^10, and I&#39;m wondering if and where I&#39;m having a conceptual error. </p>

QUESTION: <md>![image.pngNaN](/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&prefix=paste%2Fllx1rx3o8vy240%2F9f171a0cfa64e511c8321714420891e2a25b8a641f477aede479345b3b02663b%2Fimage.png)

In this approach, how can we assume that the Hamiltonian path from $$u$$ contains $$2 \cdot V_2$$ edges (all the edges in the graph)? 

The approach I used for the contradiction was slightly different: \
$$|V| - 1 \geq |V_1| > \frac{|V|}{2}$$. Consider each pair of vertices traversed along the Hamiltonian cycle from $$u$$ as pigeonholes. There are $$|V|$$ such pigeonholes. Let the vertices in $$V_1$$ be the pigeons. By GPHP, there must exist a vertex pair with at least 2 vertices of $$V_1$$. These vertices share an edge, which is a contradiction to the assumed proper 2-coloring. Is this correct?</md>
ANSWER: <p>I think your approach has an essence of a correct solution. My only concern is about the definition of pigeons and pigeonholes because $$|V_1| < |V|$$, so there are less pigeons than holes, which wouldn&#39;t lead to a great conclusion by GPHP. Maybe you mixed the definitions of pigeons/holes up. I think the approach is more or less valid, though a little extra explanation here and there could be desired, but I wouldn&#39;t think too much of it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Regarding your first question, since there is a Hamiltonian cycle, each vertex of $$V_2$$ must be visited exactly once. And each vertex can be visited by an &#34;in&#34; edge and an &#34;out&#34; edge, so $$2$$ edges for each vertex in $$V_2$$ gives us $$2 \cdot V_2$$. </p>

<p>Note that $$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \frac{n \cdot (n-1) \cdot ... \cdot (n-k+1)}{k!}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But note that $$n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot ... \cdot (n-k+1) \leq n \cdot n \cdot n \cdot ... \cdot n$$. There are $$k$$ terms being multiplied together on the LHS, so in its entirety, it is $$\leq n^k$$. Thus, substituting back in, we have $$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n \cdot (n-1) \cdot ... \cdot (n-k+1)}{k!} \leq \frac{n^k}{k!}$$ as desired</p>

QUESTION: are ramsey numbers considered fair game on the final? they&#39;re not listed as a topic in the review sessions, but they&#39;re included in lectures and recitation so I&#39;m not sure
ANSWER: yes it is fair game. If you have any questions regarding Ramsey numbers, you can ask on piazza and someone will answer!

QUESTION: Is there concept OH today?
ANSWER: no

QUESTION: <p>For the last question on ramsey numbers, can someone please explain what the 2^(- k choose 2) means? I am not understanding the math given the context of the problem. The 2 represents the number of ways to color the graph (2 colors for example) but the k choose 2 part is confusing me. Thanks!</p>

ANSWER: <p>It comes from the fact that we are trying to find the probability that the edges of $$E(S)$$ are monochromatic. Since $$G$$ is a complete graph, for any $$S \subseteq V$$, the induced subgraph formed by vertices of $$S$$ will also be complete. If $$|S| = k$$, then the induced subgraph has $$\binom{k}{2}$$ edges (this follows from the fact that a complete graph on $$n$$ vertices has $$\binom{n}{2}$$ edges, which is argued by saying that &#34;every pair of vertices needs an edge between them, and there are $$\binom{n}{2}$$ distinct pairs of vertices).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, if there are $$\binom{k}{2}$$ edges, the probability that they are all colored BLUE would be $$\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\binom{k}{2}}$$ by independence. And similarly, the probability that they are all colored RED would also be $$\left(\frac12 \right)^{\binom{k}{2}}$$. So the probability that all edges are monochromatic is $$\left(\frac12 \right)^{\binom{k}{2}} + \left(\frac12 \right)^{\binom{k}{2}} = 2 \cdot \left(\frac12 \right)^{\binom{k}{2}} = 2 \cdot 2^{-\binom{k}{2}}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The rest follows by counting the amount of $$S$$&#39;s there are.</p>

QUESTION: How do we know once we construct G&#39; that δ(G&#39;) will also be &gt;= n/2?
ANSWER: Because $$G'$$ is obtained by adding edges to $$G$$. Adding edges can only increase the degree of vertices, not decrease, so it must be that $$\delta(G') \geq n/2$$

QUESTION: Do all planar graphs have to be connected for us to apply the corollaries learned in class?
ANSWER: Not necessarily. Euler&#39;s formula only applies for connected planar graphs. However, the lemma of a planar graph with at least 2 edges has $$|E| \leq 3|V| - 6$$ is true for all planar graphs. The proofs/lemmas will specify whether or not the graph is connected 

QUESTION: When we state that the minimum degree is at most 5, for the proof in lecture 15H Question on Coloring Planar Graphs, how can we conclude that some vertex v has deg(v) &lt;= 5 if the max degree is not bounded? I think conceptually I dont really understand how the minimum bound leads to this conclusion even though the rest of the proof makes intuitive sense.
ANSWER: When we say that a graph has minimum degree of at most $$5$$, that means that if we look at all vertices, and all of their degrees, the vertex with the minimum degree has value of $$\leq 5$$. In other words, we can always find <em>some </em>vertex $$v$$ such that $$\deg(v)$$ is at most 5, or equivalently, $$\deg(v) \leq 5$$ for some vertex $$v$$.

QUESTION: I don&#39;t exactly understand what a Ramsey number is. If there are 2 conditions, then does that mean that there are 2 ramsey numbers for every k and l? How are the two related? 
ANSWER: $$R(k, l) = n$$ means that for any graph on $$n$$ vertices, there either exists a clique of size $$k$$ or there exists an independent set of size $$l$$. That is, Ramsey numbers are defined by two <em>parameters</em>, but each pair of parameters yields a single value $$n$$.

QUESTION: I am kinda stuck on the simplification here. Using geometric series, I got an answer similar, but not the same. Can you please explain these steps? Thanks!<img src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fllwhu9kqtqe2sa%2F7cfda516cdcad6f63cace888619a0da630316e45bcc68255631494785f663b3e%2Fimage.png" alt="image.pngNaN" />
ANSWER: From line 1 to line 2, we multiply both sides by $$\frac78$$. Then, to get line 3, we do (line 1) - (line 2). Finally, to get line 4, we multiply both sides by 8.

QUESTION: Is the statement &#34;a connected graph with at least 2 vertices has an edge&#34; necessary for proving that every tree with more than 2 vertices has more than 2 leaves because it establishes that there exists a path / maximal path?
ANSWER: yes

QUESTION: <p>Is a graph a subdivision of itself since an edge is a path?</p>
<p></p>

ANSWER: <blockquote><kbd>Is a graph a subdivision of itself since an edge is a path?</kbd></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Yes. </p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p><kbd>Also, are the terms subgraph and subdivision meant to be different here? Is there a reason why?</kbd></p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>There is a difference between subdivision and subgraph. A subdivision is obtained by taking an edge, and <em>introducing</em> vertices along that edge -- we are dividing an edge into a bunch of smaller edges. A subgraph does <strong>not</strong> introduce anything new. It is simply a subset of vertices and edges of the original graph</p>

QUESTION: I solved this question doing TT instead of MT to understand the process better. I got 26 instead of 26^2, and I semi-understand the intuition. I was wondering if you could explain why it makes sense for this solution to be different than MT. Because, if the question was asking the expectation of dishes you would need to get at least 1 TT it is the same solution as MT. However, the question in 12H yields different solutions.
ANSWER: <p>Here is some intuition: </p>
<p></p>
<p>When looking at MT, suppose you have hit an M, and are looking at the next letter that follows. There are 3 cases to consider:</p>
<ul><li>The next letter is a T, in which case you are done.</li><li>The next letter is an M, in which case, not all hope is lost, as you can still obtain a T immediately next.</li><li>The next letter is something else, in which case, you must &#34;restart&#34; your count.</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p>When looking at TT, there are only 2 cases to consider if you have hit a T.</p>
<ul><li>The next letter is a T, in which case you are done. </li><li>The next letter is anything else, in which case, you must &#34;restart&#34; your count.</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p>Since there is a significant difference in the cases, we would expect the values to not be identical.</p>

QUESTION: 
ANSWER: Canvas &gt; Class Recordings

QUESTION: The answer key on Canvas shows a different method, but the rubric on Gradescope says it&#39;s possible to do it with Hall&#39;s theorem. I tried this approach and was confused about proving that each member in X must have at least k&#43;1 neighbors and the subsequent step which is to apply the Hall&#39;s condition.
ANSWER: Since each vertex has degree $$ \geq 2k$$, consider an arbitrary vertex $$x \in X$$ where $$X$$ is an arbitrary subset of size $$|X| = k$$. Then, $$x$$ has at most $$k-1$$ neighbors in $$X$$, and thus at least $$2k - (k-1) = k+1$$ neighbors in $$V \setminus X$$.

QUESTION: Is it true that if we are looking at a vertex that is on the lowest level of a rooted tree, it will definitely be a leaf?
ANSWER: yeah. Consider what would happen if you argued that it was not a leaf.

QUESTION: Are the recorded review sessions posted anywhere? 
ANSWER: Canvas &gt; Class Recordings

QUESTION: I&#39;m not sure I understand the premise of the question - what does it mean by a &#34;list&#34; of colours? 
ANSWER: You can think of it as an actual physical list or just a set of viable colors. That is, each vertex will have a &#34;list&#34;/set of colors such as $$\{\text{Red}, \text{Green}, \text{Blue}\}$$. Suppose that was the list for vertex $$v_1$$. Then $$v_1$$&#39;s color MUST be one of those three colors. Also note that for two arbitrary vertices $$v_1, v_2$$, $$v_1$$&#39;s list is allowed to be different from $$v_2$$&#39;s list.

QUESTION: Could someone help explain how we got the first few steps in this calculation?<img src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fllxqtee94r59n%2Fcfb7127b8c95c87e894cb9ae297820821f386eeba0be9b8714720104c1959b14%2FScreen_Shot_2023-12-19_at_7.43.49_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2023-12-19_at_7.43.49_PM.pngNaN" />
ANSWER: <p>Yep. First line is an expansion using the conditional expectation formula (which I think we proved in lecture). From line 1 to line 2, we are applying memoryless. So the first term has a $$\Pr[Y = 1]$$ in it. This occurs with probability $$p$$, because it denotes the probability that we &#34;succeed&#34; on the first trial. Then, take a look at $$\mathbb{E}[X^2|Y = 1]$$. This reads as &#34;the expected value of $$X^2$$ given that $$Y = 1$$&#34;, or, equivalently, but less mathematically, &#34;the expected value of the &#34;number of trials until our first success&#34; squared, given that the first trial was a success. Well, if the first trial was a success ($$Y = 1$$), then it must be that the total number of trials until the first success is $$1$$, so we have $$X = 1 \implies X^2 = 1$$. Thus, $$\mathbb{E}[X^2|Y = 1] = 1$$. So that entire first term is $$p \cdot 1 = p$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The second term follows similarly, however the tricky part is $$\mathbb{E}[X^2 |Y = 0]$$. Given that $$Y = 0$$, we can&#39;t conclude that $$X = 1$$ as we did before, but we can say that &#34;we failed on the first trial, but we still need to succeed&#34;. After the first trial, the number of trials in expectation to succeed is $$\mathbb{E}[X]$$. Therefore, given $$Y = 0$$, it would be that $$\mathbb{E}[X^2 | Y = 1] = (\mathbb{E}[X] + 1)^2$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is a very &#34;intuitive&#34; explanation and is much better proven using the actual memoryless property, which is something I encourage you to do!</p>
<p></p>
<p>The remaining lines are just algebra</p>

QUESTION: Is an equivalence class always an equivalence relation? I assume so
ANSWER: An equivalence class is not the same thing as an equivalence relation, however, only equivalence relations can have equivalence classes

QUESTION: Does an equivalence relation constructed from two equivalence classes as done in Lecture 13t have to be exhaustive? aka do i have to include all possible ordered pairs of the relation or can I exclude some as long as reflexity, symmetry, and transitivity hold?
ANSWER: In the case of the example in 13T, the answer provided is the <em>only</em> correct answer. You have to be really careful when coming up with the elements of the relation because not only must you ensure that reflexivity, transitivity, and symmetry hold, but you must also ensure that the equivalence classes are valid. That is, if I chose to exclude, say, $$(1, 3)$$ from $$R$$, then that would be an invalid answer, because $$1$$ and $$3$$ would no longer be in the same equivalence class. 

QUESTION: On the review session, for a r.v. X,  there exists an object for which X \geq E[X] and there exists an object for which X \leq E[X]. Is this because there&#39;s an equal sign? I understand the X \geq E[X] part, but I don&#39;t understand the X \leq E[X] part. 
ANSWER: There&#39;s a pretty decent explanation of this at the ~13:50 minute mark of the recording. But yes, it is important to conclude that $$\exists X$$ such that $$X \leq \mathbb{E}[X]$$ instead of $$X < \mathbb{E}[X]$$. That is, a strict inequality would be an incorrect conclusion. This can be argued by contradiction where you assume that all $$X > \mathbb{E}[X]$$, and then you contradict that the actual value that $$\mathbb{E}[X]$$ is cannot be.

QUESTION: Do we have the solutions for HW15H?
ANSWER: yeah they should be on canvas

QUESTION: For 2b, the equivalence classes are the set of red vertices and the set of blue vertices. The expected number of red vertices is n/3, and the expected number of blue vertices is 2n/3. Then, why isn&#39;t |R| = (n/3)^2 &#43; (2n/3)^2 = 5n^2/9?
ANSWER: <p>This is a really good question!</p>
<p></p>
<p>If $$X$$ is a random variable denoting the number of red vertices, and $$Y$$ is a random variable denoting the number of blue vertices, then, as you have implicitly noted, $$|R| = X \cdot X + Y \cdot Y$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, $$\mathbb{E}[|R|] = \mathbb{E}[X \cdot X + Y \cdot Y] = \mathbb{E}[X^2] + \mathbb{Y^2}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But it is important to note that it is not always true that $$\mathbb{E}[X^2] = \mathbb{E}[X]^2$$. The equation you have provided is assuming that $$\mathbb{E}[X^2] = \mathbb{E}[X]^2 = (n/3)^2$$, which is incorrect</p>
