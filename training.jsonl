I&#39;ll give you an example to show how\u00a0<em>both\u00a0</em>proof approaches could work.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>Prove: for a positive integer $$x$$, if $$x$$ is even, then $$x + 2$$ is even.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em></em></p>\n<p>Contradiction: Suppose that $$x + 2$$ is not even. Then, $$x + 2$$ is odd, so we have $$x + 2 = 2k + 1 $$ for some $$k \\in \\mathbb Z$$. Then, $$x = 2k + 1 - 2 = 2k - 1 = 2(k-1) + 1$$. Since $$k-1 \\in \\mathbb Z$$, we have that $$x$$ is odd, which is a contradiction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Contrapositive: Our contrapositive statement is: If $$x + 2$$ is odd, then $$x$$ is odd. Well, if $$x + 2$$ is odd, then $$x + 2 = 2k + 1$$ for some $$k \\in \\mathbb Z$$. Then, $$x = 2k + 1 - 2 = 2(k-1) + 1$$ and since $$k-1 \\in \\mathbb Z$$, then $$x$$ is odd and our contrapositive statement is proved.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You can see that in both proofs, we are doing very similar things. With contradiction, we are essentially\u00a0<em>adding\u00a0</em>a new assumption (in the above case, assuming that $$x+2$$ is odd), and our goal is to contradict one of our assumptions. In contrapositive, we are starting with a new hypothesis in a sense and working in the opposite direction.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Contrapositive works when we have an &#34;If... then...&#34; statement (as these words imply implication).

{"input_text": "QUESTION: Title!\n", "output_text": "ANSWER: <p>Adding two outcomes works best when we perform &#34;casework&#34;. That is, when solving a problem, we decide to break it down into smaller sub-problems (by perhaps casing on a constraint) and then adding all the values together to get a final value. Addition works when our casework is\u00a0<em>disjoint</em> -- that is, no situation appears in multiple cases. You may also notice that adding (aka the addition rule) is essentially a corollary of PIE. In case this isn&#39;t clear, most problems that ask for a numeric answer can be considered as finding the cardinality of some set. Call this set $$A$$. Suppose we decompose the set $$A$$ into subsets $$A_1, A_2, A_3$$. Then, we want to find $$|A| = |A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3|$$.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>using PIE, we have $$|A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3| = |A_1| + |A_2| + |A_3| - |A_1 \\cap A_2|\u00a0 - |A_1 \\cap A_3| - |A_2 \\cap A_3| + |A_1 \\cap A_2 \\cap A_3|$$.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Admittedly, this does not really look like the addition rule, but more often than not, we define $$A_1, A_2, A_3$$ in such a way that they are disjoint. That is, $$A_i \\cap A_j = \\emptyset$$. With this, a lot of terms in the PIE are equal to 0 and we are left with $$|A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3| = |A_1| + |A_2| + |A_3|$$.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>TL;DR: If we decompose our problem into sub-problems that are disjoint, then we typically use the addition rule.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As for multiplication rule, this is often used for a multi-step procedure. That is, instead of decomposing a problem into separate smaller problems that must be solved &#34;in whole&#34;, we instead decompose a problem into a step-by-step procedure.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The difference now is that we are looking at &#34;all cases&#34; to be considered and breaking down a procedure whereas for addition, we were looking at &#34;some cases&#34; at a time.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When you have a procedure, you can consider the amount of ways to perform each step. If the amount of ways to perform each step is\u00a0<strong>constant</strong> regardless of how the prior steps were performed, then you can use the multiplication rule to find the total amount of ways the procedure can be carried out.</p>\n"}

{"input_text": "QUESTION: <p>For Q7, I provided an alternate solution to using strong induction to prove that any string of length n could be written in the form x = y \\cdot z.

That is, a string of length j can be written in the form x = y \\cdot z&#34;. For the induction step, I partitioned the string of length k&#43;1 into two nonempty binary strings of length a and b. Since 0 is less than or equal to a, b is less than or equal to k, the induction hypothesis could be used to say that both strings could be written as concatenation. Since in both strings, the number of 0&#39;s in y is equal to the number of 1&#39;s in z, a string of length k&#43;1 can be written as concatenation such that the number of 0&#39;s in y is equal to the number of 1&#39;s in z (by way of adding the values). Thus, the induction step is proven.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I was wondering if this solution works for the proof.</p>\n", "output_text": "ANSWER: I don&#39;t think this is quite right. Because if you split $$x = y \\cdot z$$ and then apply the IH on $$y$$ and $$z$$ then you have $$x = (p_1 \\cdot q_1) \\cdot (p_2 \\cdot q_2)$$ where the number of 0s in $$p_i$$ is equal to the number of $$1$$s in $$q_i$$.

{"input_text": "QUESTION: The answer key on Canvas shows a different method, but the rubric on Gradescope says it&#39;s possible to do it with Hall&#39;s theorem.

That is, each vertex will have a &#34;list&#34;/set of colors such as $$\\{\\text{Red}, \\text{Green}, \\text{Blue}\\}$$. Suppose that was the list for vertex $$v_1$$.

First line is an expansion using the conditional expectation formula (which I think we proved in lecture). From line 1 to line 2, we are applying memoryless. So the first term has a $$\\Pr[Y = 1]$$ in it. This occurs with probability $$p$$, because it denotes the probability that we &#34;succeed&#34; on the first trial. Then, take a look at $$\\mathbb{E}[X^2|Y = 1]$$. This reads as &#34;the expected value of $$X^2$$ given that $$Y = 1$$&#34;, or, equivalently, but less mathematically, &#34;the expected value of the &#34;number of trials until our first success&#34; squared, given that the first trial was a success. Well, if the first trial was a success ($$Y = 1$$), then it must be that the total number of trials until the first success is $$1$$, so we have $$X = 1 \\implies X^2 = 1$$. Thus, $$\\mathbb{E}[X^2|Y = 1] = 1$$. So that entire first term is $$p \\cdot 1 = p$$.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The second term follows similarly, however the tricky part is $$\\mathbb{E}[X^2 |Y = 0]$$. Given that $$Y = 0$$, we can&#39;t conclude that $$X = 1$$ as we did before, but we can say that &#34;we failed on the first trial, but we still need to succeed&#34;. After the first trial, the number of trials in expectation to succeed is $$\\mathbb{E}[X]$$. Therefore, given $$Y = 0$$, it would be that $$\\mathbb{E}[X^2 | Y = 1] = (\\mathbb{E}[X] + 1)^2$$.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is a very &#34;intuitive&#34; explanation and is much better proven using the actual memoryless property, which is something I encourage you to do!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The remaining lines are just algebra</p>\n"}

You have to be really careful when coming up with the elements of the relation because not only must you ensure that reflexivity, transitivity, and symmetry hold, but you must also ensure that the equivalence classes are valid.

But yes, it is important to conclude that $$\\exists X$$ such that $$X \\leq \\mathbb{E}[X]$$ instead of $$X < \\mathbb{E}[X]$$. That is, a strict inequality would be an incorrect conclusion.
