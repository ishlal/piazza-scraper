Then, $$x + 2$$ is odd, so we have $$x + 2 = 2k + 1 $$ for some $$k \\in \\mathbb Z$$. Then, $$x = 2k + 1 - 2 = 2k - 1 = 2(k-1) + 1$$. Since $$k-1 \\in \\mathbb Z$$, we have that $$x$$ is odd, which is a contradiction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Contrapositive: Our contrapositive statement is: If $$x + 2$$ is odd, then $$x$$ is odd. Well, if $$x + 2$$ is odd, then $$x + 2 = 2k + 1$$ for some $$k \\in \\mathbb Z$$. Then, $$x = 2k + 1 - 2 = 2(k-1) + 1$$ and since $$k-1 \\in \\mathbb Z$$, then $$x$$ is odd and our contrapositive statement is proved.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You can see that in both proofs, we are doing very similar things. With contradiction, we are essentially\u00a0<em>adding\u00a0</em>a new assumption (in the above case, assuming that $$x+2$$ is odd), and our goal is to contradict one of our assumptions. In contrapositive, we are starting with a new hypothesis in a sense and working in the opposite direction.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Contrapositive works when we have an &#34;If... then...&#34; statement (as these words imply implication).

{"input_text": "QUESTION: Title!\n", "output_text": "ANSWER: <p>Adding two outcomes works best when we perform &#34;casework&#34;. That is, when solving a problem, we decide to break it down into smaller sub-problems (by perhaps casing on a constraint) and then adding all the values together to get a final value. Addition works when our casework is\u00a0<em>disjoint</em> -- that is, no situation appears in multiple cases. You may also notice that adding (aka the addition rule) is essentially a corollary of PIE. In case this isn&#39;t clear, most problems that ask for a numeric answer can be considered as finding the cardinality of some set. Call this set $$A$$. Suppose we decompose the set $$A$$ into subsets $$A_1, A_2, A_3$$. Then, we want to find $$|A| = |A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3|$$.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>using PIE, we have $$|A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3| = |A_1| + |A_2| + |A_3| - |A_1 \\cap A_2|\u00a0 - |A_1 \\cap A_3| - |A_2 \\cap A_3| + |A_1 \\cap A_2 \\cap A_3|$$.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Admittedly, this does not really look like the addition rule, but more often than not, we define $$A_1, A_2, A_3$$ in such a way that they are disjoint. That is, $$A_i \\cap A_j = \\emptyset$$. With this, a lot of terms in the PIE are equal to 0 and we are left with $$|A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3| = |A_1| + |A_2| + |A_3|$$.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>TL;DR: If we decompose our problem into sub-problems that are disjoint, then we typically use the addition rule.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As for multiplication rule, this is often used for a multi-step procedure. That is, instead of decomposing a problem into separate smaller problems that must be solved &#34;in whole&#34;, we instead decompose a problem into a step-by-step procedure.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The difference now is that we are looking at &#34;all cases&#34; to be considered and breaking down a procedure whereas for addition, we were looking at &#34;some cases&#34; at a time.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When you have a procedure, you can consider the amount of ways to perform each step. If the amount of ways to perform each step is\u00a0<strong>constant</strong> regardless of how the prior steps were performed, then you can use the multiplication rule to find the total amount of ways the procedure can be carried out.</p>\n"}

{"input_text": "QUESTION: <p>For Q7, I provided an alternate solution to using strong induction to prove that any string of length n could be written in the form x = y \\cdot z.

That is, a string of length j can be written in the form x = y \\cdot z&#34;. For the induction step, I partitioned the string of length k&#43;1 into two nonempty binary strings of length a and b. Since 0 is less than or equal to a, b is less than or equal to k, the induction hypothesis could be used to say that both strings could be written as concatenation. Since in both strings, the number of 0&#39;s in y is equal to the number of 1&#39;s in z, a string of length k&#43;1 can be written as concatenation such that the number of 0&#39;s in y is equal to the number of 1&#39;s in z (by way of adding the values).

First line is an expansion using the conditional expectation formula (which I think we proved in lecture). From line 1 to line 2, we are applying memoryless. So the first term has a $$\\Pr[Y = 1]$$ in it. This occurs with probability $$p$$, because it denotes the probability that we &#34;succeed&#34; on the first trial. Then, take a look at $$\\mathbb{E}[X^2|Y = 1]$$. This reads as &#34;the expected value of $$X^2$$ given that $$Y = 1$$&#34;, or, equivalently, but less mathematically, &#34;the expected value of the &#34;number of trials until our first success&#34; squared, given that the first trial was a success. Well, if the first trial was a success ($$Y = 1$$), then it must be that the total number of trials until the first success is $$1$$, so we have $$X = 1 \\implies X^2 = 1$$. Thus, $$\\mathbb{E}[X^2|Y = 1] = 1$$. So that entire first term is $$p \\cdot 1 = p$$.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The second term follows similarly, however the tricky part is $$\\mathbb{E}[X^2 |Y = 0]$$. Given that $$Y = 0$$, we can&#39;t conclude that $$X = 1$$ as we did before, but we can say that &#34;we failed on the first trial, but we still need to succeed&#34;. After the first trial, the number of trials in expectation to succeed is $$\\mathbb{E}[X]$$. Therefore, given $$Y = 0$$, it would be that $$\\mathbb{E}[X^2 | Y = 1] = (\\mathbb{E}[X] + 1)^2$$.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is a very &#34;intuitive&#34; explanation and is much better proven using the actual memoryless property, which is something I encourage you to do!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The remaining lines are just algebra</p>\n"}

You have to be really careful when coming up with the elements of the relation because not only must you ensure that reflexivity, transitivity, and symmetry hold, but you must also ensure that the equivalence classes are valid.

I understood all the mathematical computations on why x (an arbitrary element) belongs to A, but got stuck on the reasoning why by given that x \u2208 A and x \u2208 (A \\ B) \u222a (A \u2229 B),\u00a0 (A \\ B) \u222a (A \u2229 B) \u2286 A\u00a0 must be true. Why couldn&#39;t it be the other way around where A \u2286 (A \\ B) \u222a (A \u2229 B) ?\u00a0<br /><br />Thanks in advance!\u00a0</p>\n", "output_text": "ANSWER: <p>Well that conclusion is being made because we are under the case of showing that $$(A \\setminus B) \\cup (A \\cap B) \\subseteq A$$. Remember, to show equality, we show inclusion in both directions. So focusing on the direction $$(A \\setminus B) \\cup (A \\cap B) \\subseteq A$$, we would want to show that for any element that appears in the left hand side, it must also appear in the right hand side. 2.sp2 argues that for any element $$x \\in (A \\setminus B) \\cup (A \\cap B)$$, we have $$x \\in A$$, so we have that any element in the left hand side also appears in the right hand side (since x was arbitrary), and by definition of subset, we conclude that the left hand side is a subset of the right hand side.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We then go on to show the inclusion in the other direction. And to show that, we would go about taking an arbitrary element of $$A$$ and show that it appears in $$(A \\setminus B) \\cup (A \\cap B)$$.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I think the key thing to note is the definition of subset. We have $$A \\subset B$$ if and only if for every element $$a \\in A$$, we also have $$a \\in B$$. That&#39;s what we are doing in the set proofs; we consider an element $$a \\in A$$ and then show that it must be that $$a \\in B$$ and then conclude that $$A \\subseteq B$$</p>\n"}

{"input_text": "QUESTION: \n", "output_text": "ANSWER: <p>In one sentence: Stars and bars is an\u00a0<strong>application</strong> of simple combinations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For more detail, with simple combinations, such as $$\\binom{n}{r}$$, we are simply considering a set of $$n$$ distinct items and determining how many ways can we choose $$r$$ of these items. Equivalently, this counts the number of subsets of size $$r$$ from our original set.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Stars and bars can be thought of as a two step procedure. We see a direct correlation between distributing indistinguishable items to distinguishable containers with an arrangement of stars and bars. So to count the number of ways to distribute, we count the number of arrangements of stars and bars. Suppose we have $$n$$ stars and $$r-1$$ bars, then our procedure would begin by choosing $$n$$ locations to put the stars. Since the remaining open slots\u00a0<strong>must</strong> be filled with bars, they can only be filled in one way. So by MR, you get the familiar equation for stars and bars which is $$\\binom{n + r - 1}{n}$$, or equivalently, $$\\binom{n+r-1}{r-1}$$</p>\n"}

Note that $$\\phi \\in [1..n]^{[1..n]}$$, so it is in the domain. Note that $$\\phi$$ takes as input $$x \\in [1..n]$$ and outputs some $$y \\in [1..n]$$.

This means, $$\\forall x \\in [1..n]$$ we have $$f(x) = x$$. We want to compute $$g(f)$$. This is equivalent to asking: &#34;What is the set $$A \\subseteq [1..n]$$ such that $$\\forall a \\in A$$ we have $$f(a) = 1$$?&#34;.

From here we can restart the process considering TA t2 to be the new potential supreme TA, the set W to be the same set as before &#43; t1 &#43; any number of elements in the set L that t2 directly beats (key point is that |W| can increase from before as it only gains new elements and can not lose element).

{"input_text": "QUESTION: Why are we solving for when we are returning the ith pair of sock? How does this lead us to find the expected pair of socks\n", "output_text": "ANSWER: <p>The total amount of socks being returned can be thought of as a sum of a bunch of $$1$$&#39;s and $$0$$&#39;s, where a 1 indicates if the sock has been returned and a 0 otherwise. For example, suppose we put in 3 pairs of socks (we&#39;ll label these pairs A, B, and C) and only received 2 back. And further, suppose that we didn&#39;t receive pair B back. Then, it is true that we received 1 &#43; 0 &#43; 1 = 2 pairs back (1 for A and 1 for C). This is essentially what indicators are. So if we were to define an indicator for each pair of socks, and sum them all together, we would get the total amount of pairs returned.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus, if $$S = I_1 + I_2 + ... + I_n$$, then $$\\mathbb{E}[S] = \\mathbb{E}[I_1 + I_2 + ... + I_n]$$. And by using Linearity of Expectation, we have this being equal to $$\\mathbb{E}[I_1] + \\mathbb{E}[I_2] + ... + \\mathbb{E}[I_n] = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{E}[I_i]$$.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So our problem has been reduced to finding the expected value of an indicator, where the indicator is whether or not the $$i$$th pair is returned. By finding this value, we can easily obtain $$\\mathbb{E}[S]$$ using the math above.</p>\n"}

For example, the number of ways performing step 4 depends upon whether a zero was chosen in the earlier steps.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also in the president, secretary, treasurer question, the solution says multiplication rule does not apply because outcome of prior step changes later # outcomes. What&#39;s the logic that distinguishes the approaches to these two questions?\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Is it that in a question in which there are multiple ways of performing the steps, only one sequence of steps allows multiplication rule to be applied and other sequences of events do not? thank you.</p>\n", "output_text": "ANSWER: <p>Note that only Attempt 3 shows a correct solution for the &#34;odd numbers&#34; question. In that attempt, we can see that we will not select the number zero in steps 1 and 2. Only the second digit and the third digit can be zeroes, which is why they are placed last in our ordering of steps. But these steps also acknowledge the fact that, for example, the second digit cannot be the same as the first or fourth digit (whose digits have already been chosen), which is why there are 10 - 2 = 8 ways to perform step 3. And similar logic holds for step 4.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;m not sure I completely understand your second question, but I&#39;ll try my best to give some information that may clear things up. Steps within your process that you develop for counting CAN depend on each other, but we can only perform MR when each step has a CONSTANT number of ways of being performed. For example, in attempt 1 of the &#34;secretary&#34; question, the third step can be performed in 2 ways if, for example, Bob is President and Ann is Treasurer, 1 way if, for example, Bob is president and Clyde is secretary, or 0 ways if, for example, Clyde is president and Dan is secretary. Since this is NOT a constant value, the MR can&#39;t really be used.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Whereas, in attempt 2, since we chose the secretary first, the remaining two steps always have the same constant number of people to choose from.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For your last question, no. There can be many ways of ordering the steps.

While saying that $$\\sum_{v \\in V} deg(v) > 5n$$ is not false, the value of $$5n$$ is a weak lower bound.
